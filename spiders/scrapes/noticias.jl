{"titulo": "Drinking water in Tehran could run dry in two weeks, Iranian official says", "texto": "The main source of drinking water for residents of the Iranian capital Tehran is at risk of running dry within two weeks, according to state media, due to a historic drought plaguing the country. The Amir Kabir Dam, one of five that provide drinking water for Tehran, “holds just 14 million cubic metres of water, which is eight percent of its capacity”, the director of the capital’s water company, Behzad Parsa, was quoted as saying by the IRNA news agency on Sunday. At that level, it can only continue to supply Tehran with water “for two weeks”, he warned. The announcement comes as the country experiences its worst drought in decades. The level of rainfall in Tehran province was “nearly without precedent for a century”, a local official declared last month. The megacity of more than 10 million people is nestled against the southern slopes of the often snow-capped Alborz Mountains, which soar as high as 5,600 metres (18,370 feet) and whose rivers feed multiple reservoirs. A year ago, the Amir Kabir dam held back 86 million cubic metres of water, Parsa said, but there had been a “100 percent drop in precipitation” in the Tehran region. Parsa did not provide details on the status of the other reservoirs in the system. According to Iranian media, the population of Tehran consumes around three million cubic metres of water each day. As a water-saving measure, supplies have reportedly been cut off to several neighbourhoods in recent days, while outages were frequent this summer. In July and August, two public holidays were declared to save water and energy, with power cuts an almost daily occurrence amid that saw temperatures rise beyond 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in Tehran and exceed 50C (122F) in some areas. “The water crisis is more serious than what is being discussed today,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned at the time. Water scarcity is a major issue throughout Iran, particularly in arid provinces in the country’s south, with shortages blamed on mismanagement and overexploitation of underground resources, as well as the growing impact of climate change. Iran’s neighbour Iraq is since 1993, as the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, which flow into the Persian Gulf from West Asia, have seen their levels drop by up to 27 percent due to poor rainfall and upstream water restrictions, leading to a severe humanitarian crisis in the country’s south.", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/drinking-water-tehran-could-run-191615230.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}

The 35 fatalities took place in Hue, Da Nang, Lam Dong and Quang Tri provinces, the Vietnam Disaster and Dyke Management Authority (VDDMA) said in a report. Hoi An's ancient town that is a UNESCO world heritage site has been inundated with waist-deep water, with residents navigating the city by wooden boats after a major local river overflowed at a 60-year high. \"Everyone is in shock after the flood. People were preparing for the flood, but they didn't expect the water to rise so high,\" Hoi An resident Chuong Nguyen told AFP on Sunday. \"Many homes weren't able to get ready in time, so a lot of belongings were damaged,\" the 43-year-old said as rain continued Sunday. \"Everyone feels helpless due to the severe damage.\" - More deadly and destructive - More than 16,500 houses are currently flooded, the VDDMA says, while more than 40,000 poultry and livestock have been swept away and more than 5,300 hectares (13,000 acres) of cropland submerged.

{"titulo": "Israeli air strike kills four in Lebanon, straining fragile ceasefire", "texto": "An Israeli air strike has killed at least four people in southern Lebanon, according to the country’s Ministry of Public Health, in an attack that put on a nearly yearlong truce with Hezbollah. In a statement on Saturday, the Lebanese Health Ministry said the Israeli attack in the town of Kfarsir in the Nabatieh district also wounded three. The state-run Lebanon News Agency reported that the strike, which involved a “guided missile”, targeted a car at about 2:15pm (16:15 GMT). The attack came a day after Lebanese President Joseph Aoun accused Israel of escalating strikes in response to his a more lasting end to the cross-border attacks. The conflict began in 2023 when Hezbollah began launching attacks on Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, in the wake of the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel. After more than a year of fighting, the two sides agreed to a ceasefire in November 2024. Despite the truce, Israel has kept troops in five areas of southern Lebanon and has continued near-daily air raids, repeatedly violating the truce. Israel claims it is targeting Hezbollah, but civilians, first responders and journalists have also been killed. According to the United Nations, Israeli forces have killed at least 111 civilians in Lebanon since the ceasefire went into effect. Aoun, who called for negotiations with Israel in mid-October, after United States President Donald Trump brokered a ceasefire, said his proposed talks seek to “end the Israeli occupation”. For its part, Israel has claimed Lebanon’s government has not upheld its side of the ceasefire by failing to constrain and disarm Hezbollah. The armed group rejects the pressure for it to disarm. In another sign of heightening tensions, Aoun earlier this week Lebanon’s armed forces to confront any new Israeli incursion in the south. The order came hours after Israeli soldiers entered the border town of Blida. They stormed the town hall, killing municipal worker Ibrahim Salameh, who had been sleeping there, the state-owned National News Agency (NNA) said. Israel’s military said the operation was meant to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, saying that soldiers had opened fire in response to an “immediate threat”.

{"titulo": "We’re protecting Israel by praying, insist ultra-Orthodox Jews", "texto": "In the middle of a six-lane interchange at the main entrance to Jerusalem, 200,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews are beseeching God for protection – not from Hamas or Hezbollah, but from the . In particular, from . “My family came here 240 years ago and have studied the Torah ever since,” a young man called Chaim shouts above the din. “Now they want to call me into the army? It’s not happening. I’m going to continue studying Torah. The army can die.” Someone with a tallit over his head and a book of psalms in one hand raises his arms to the sky, but his anguished prayers are drowned out by the blast of a ram’s horn. Swarms of protesters have climbed on to the roofs of the nearby petrol stations. Dozens are stuffed into, and standing precariously on top of, the motorway gantry, their banners obscuring the signs to Tel Aviv. The heavily armed police have long since given up trying to stop the crowds accessing the famous Chords railway bridge. Coils of razor wire have been swept aside as if by an omnipotent hand. It’s chaos, which, you get the feeling, is exactly what this loose federation of sects known collectively in Israel as the Haredim is aiming for. Defined by intensive, almost hourly prayer and the study of scripture, they have been exempted from since the birth of the Jewish state. This has been accompanied by a range of government subsidies to fund the yeshivas, religious education institutes that are central to Haredi life. In 1948, the community only made up 3 per cent of Israelis. Today, they constitute roughly 14 per cent of the general population and nearly one in five of all Jews in Israel, thanks mainly to their prolific birth rate. With the army exhausted after two years of and short of approximately 12,000 full-time soldiers in the immediate term, a consensus is hardening that the historical anomaly of exemption has to end. Moshe Tur-Paz, a member of the opposition Yesh Atid party in the Knesset who sits on the foreign and defence committee, said the military failure of Oct 7, plus the slow progress of the subsequent campaign, shows that Israel needs “tens of battalions more” to meet its security needs. A paratrooper and one of two Knesset members to have served in the Gaza conflict, albeit in a headquarters role, he said: “There are 100,000 Haredi boys between 18 to 37 who have never served in the army. “If they served, that would solve all our human resources problems. If even 50 per cent of them serve, that would cover most of our needs.” In June last year, the Supreme Court ruled the exemption to be unlawful. Technically, ultra-Orthodox men who refuse their mandatory call-up can now be jailed, although in practice this has not yet been widely enforced. Knesset members are currently wrangling over a against those who refuse to serve. However, its authors have been accused of watering down the bill at the behest of Benjamin Netanyahu, who to stay in power. The successful passage of this particular bill is uncertain. It means that, as well as the threat of jail time, financial sanctions plus others such as travel bans and a prohibition on obtaining a driving licence are all up for debate. The result is that no one is happy: not the generals; not the hundreds of thousands of young Israeli reservists whose lives have been put on hold by multiple traumatic tours of duty; nor the Haredim themselves, who feel persecuted by the threat of being dragged into the IDF. Contrary to some stereotypes, many are not pacifists. They simply cannot reconcile their religious way of life with membership of an institution which – despite becoming steadily more religious – is still seen as a symbol of secular Israel, a legacy of the political secularism of the country’s socialist founders. Michail Fux, 22, said he currently prays or studies the Torah and other sacred texts and laws for nearly eight hours a day. “Of course we need people in the army, but I’m afraid that if I go in, I will come out secular,” he said. Routh Rathleen, a middle-aged woman, angrily interjects, explaining that two of her sons had joined an IDF unit specially tailored for ultra-Orthodox recruits, but that they had become less godly the longer they served. “It was a disaster,” she fumed. According to IDF figures, 2,940 Haredi men were drafted in 2024, of whom 1,300 entered through dedicated ultra-Orthodox schemes and the rest through general service. Worried and angry, the Haredi community is unafraid to show its power. Thursday’s protest, in which a young man died after falling from a building, paralysed Israel’s capital, shutting down the highway to Tel Aviv and forcing the city’s main railway and bus stations to close. The fact is, while many demonstrators expressed polite admiration for the men and women who serve in the IDF, they believe that they are protecting the Jewish people every bit as much through prayer. Some say it more explicitly than others, but the underlying theme is that if more people pleased God by living as the ultra-Orthodox do, Israel would not require an army because they would not have enemies. “It’s the Torah that has the power to protect,” said Mr Fux. Shlomo Cohen, originally from South Africa, made a similar point. “God looks after us; prayer protects us,” he said. “If you have a religious identity you don’t have to worry about Hamas.” The sense of resentment among the ultra-Orthodox at the prospect of mandatory service derives, in part, from a feeling that they live lives of profound sacrifice on behalf of the wider Jewish people, keeping the flame of what they see as authentic Judaism alive. Many are extremely poor, thanks to the large amount of economically inactive time they spend studying scripture, coupled with the number of children they have. The live birth rate was 6.4 per Haredi woman in 2020-22, according to the Israel Democracy Institute, compared to 2.5 among Jewish women in Israel more broadly. Therein lies the Haredi dilemma. The ultra-Orthodox community has increased its political power thanks to the growth of its voter base. Mr Netanyahu currently relies on it for 18 Knesset seats in his 67-member coalition majority. In parliamentary terms, they are unignorable while Israel continues its steady shift to the Right. But as the community grows, it also becomes increasingly unignorable as a source of military manpower. Secular commentators are framing the conscription issue as a fundamental fork in the road for the Zionist project. Does Israel move forward on the basis of its founding ideals, as a nation of immigrants bound together by both racial Jewish identity and the democratising shared bond of military service? Or does one part of society continue to shoulder an increasingly heavy burden for another? Writing in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper this week, veteran journalist Ari Shavit described the situation as “us or them”. Either the Haredi are absorbed into the military, he argued, or the nation will implode. “Israel will become a benighted third-world country.” Mr Tur-Paz told The Telegraph that he hoped to see a truly “Zionist” government following future elections – the next of which must take place by the end of October 2026. “I hope there will be a consensus that you can’t form a government with the ultra-Orthodox if they are not willing to pass legislation [for mandatory conscription] and go into the army.” Some within the Haredim go against the grain of their community. They see military service not only as a moral necessity, but as an opportunity to better integrate what has always been quite an isolated community into Israeli society. Rabbi Yehoshua Pfeffer is chairman of the Netzach Yehuda Association, which aims to , and has helped pioneer tailored units that allows them to continue living as religiously as possible. “We want to produce the role models that come out on the other side as good religious voices, to demonstrate that it can be done,” he said. “The fact that Haredi society is becoming so large requires it to take responsibility. You have to pay the price of your success.” He believes that the most gifted yeshiva students should continue to be exempt, but that threatening the rest with jail is a waste of time. Economic incentives and disincentives, even quite punitive, are more effective, the rabbi believes. “The profoundly secular nature of the army has shifted a lot in recent years. It’s a very different place,” he said, adding that ultra-Orthodox Jews are already increasingly exposed to mainstream society through technological and economic change. “My argument is that if you are going to enter [society] it is better doing it from a position of strength and confidence, rather than just being dragged in.”", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/protecting-israel-praying-insist-ultra-060000860.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}

In a statement Sunday evening, police said the only remaining suspect is a 32-year-old British man who remains in custody on suspicion of attempted murder. A second man initially arrested as a suspect was released without charge after it was determined the 35-year-old was not involved. Police said they are not treating the stabbings as an act of terror and are confident they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the attack. They have not disclosed a possible motive or the type of knife used. “Our investigation is moving at pace and we are confident we are not looking for anyone else in connection to the incident,\" said Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Cundy of the British Transport Police. “As would be expected, specialist detectives are looking into the background of the suspect we have in custody and the events that led up to the attack,\" he added. Six people remained in hospitals Sunday, one of them in a life-threatening condition. Police said he is a staff member of the train's operator, London North Eastern Railway, or LNER, which operates the East Coast Mainline services in the U.K. “Having viewed the CCTV from the train, the actions of the member of rail staff were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved people’s lives,\" said Cundy. The five others injured during the attack on Saturday evening have been discharged from hospitals. The two men were arrested eight minutes after the first emergency calls were made at 7:42 p.m. Saturday from aboard the train, where passengers had reported , with many running through the carriages and some seeking safety in the toilets. Police said the suspect is from Peterborough and that he boarded the train at the town's station, just a few minutes before it was forced into an emergency stop in Huntingdon, a market town around 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of London. The attack took place as the 6:25 p.m. train from Doncaster in northern England to London’s King’s Cross station was about halfway through its two-hour journey, having just departed Peterborough. Bloodied and confused passengers spilled out of the train at Huntingdon as dozens of police waited, some of them armed. A knife was recovered by officers at the scene. During the immediate response to the attack, police said that “Plato,” the national code word used by police and emergency services when responding to what could be a “marauding terror attack,” was initiated. That declaration was later rescinded. Passenger Olly Foster told the BBC he heard people shouting “run, run, there’s a guy literally stabbing everyone,” and initially thought it might have been a Halloween prank — Saturday was the day after Halloween. But as passengers pushed past him to get away, he noticed his hand was covered in blood from a chair he had leaned on. Following reports that some of those on board the train put themselves in harm's way to protect others, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood praised the “exceptional bravery of staff and passengers on the train.\" King Charles III said he and his wife, Queen Camilla, sent their sympathies and thoughts to those affected and that they were “truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack.\" Passengers across the U.K.'s rail network saw a heightened police presence on Sunday, both on trains and at stations.", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/uk-police-detain-2-suspects-062450475.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}

Growing numbers are finding work in the business of death as South Korea undergoes massive demographic change, with birth rates among the lowest in the world and almost half the population aged 50 or older. Students at the Busan Institute of Science and Technology carefully draped a mannequin in traditional Korean funeral cloth, smoothing the fabric as if over real skin, before gently lowering it into a coffin. \"With our society ageing, I thought the demand for this kind of work would only grow,\" said Jang Jin-yeong, 27, a funeral administration student. Another student, 23-year-old Im Sae-jin, decided to enter the field after his grandmother died. \"At her funeral, I saw how beautifully the directors had prepared her for the final farewell,\" he said. \"I felt deeply grateful.\" - 'Like portraits' - More and more South Koreans are also living -- and dying -- alone. Single-person households now account for around 42 percent of all homes in Asia's fourth-largest economy. A new profession has emerged reflecting that statistic: cleaners who are called in to tidy up homes after their occupants, most of whom lived alone, have died. Former classical musician Cho Eun-seok has cleaned many homes where people were found dead, sometimes months after their passing. Their homes are \"like their portraits\", Cho, 47, told AFP. He described heartbreaking traces: hundreds of neatly capped soju bottles and dusty boxes of gifts that were never opened. South Korea has the highest suicide rate among developed nations, and these \"lonely deaths\" include those who died alone by their own hand. Cho recently began receiving calls from used-car leasing companies to clean vehicles later found to be where clients ended their lives. He is also developing a device to detect signs of unattended deaths that he said can harm the environment, causing pest infestations and forcing the disposal of belongings from entire households. In summer, the smell spreads fast, he said, \"and nothing can be saved\". The home of a woman who had died recently in her late eighties was still filled with traces of her life when AFP visited -- an old air conditioner, bottles of cosmetics and a portable toilet, while several walking sticks stood by the door. - 'Everything must be cleared away' - The work sometimes requires more than just cleaning. Kim Seok-jung once cleared the home of a late lyricist and found a set of songs she had not shared with her relatives. He turned them into a song for the bereaved family. And Cho remembered a high school girl who lived alone in a gosiwon -- a cramped room typically less than five square metres -- after she escaped domestic violence. He visited once a month to clean. The teenager, suffering from depression, had been unable to tidy up herself. Piles of belongings and rotting food covered the bed and the air was thick with flies. But she carefully looked after a small box, insisting Cho never throw it away. She took her own life in that small room a year later. When Cho returned to clean, he found that a hamster had been living in the box all along. Beside it sat her guitar -- she had dreamed of becoming a musician. \"The moment I saw the hamster, all I could think was that I had to save it and keep it alive,\" Cho said. Kim Doo-nyeon, a veteran in the funeral business, said he has a growing number of recruits in their twenties. \"When people live together, they share things... even if one person dies, those items remain,\" he said. \"But when someone dies alone, everything must be cleared away.\" Back at class in Busan, Im admitted to some trepidation about his chosen career path. \"I am scared,\" he said. \"No matter how much you prepare, facing a deceased person is frightening.\" cdl/oho/pbt", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/death-becomes-growing-business-ageing-033145107.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}

A Russian drone attack on a car park in the Odesa region, on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, in the early hours of Sunday killed two people, according to the State Emergency Service. Odesa regional head Oleh Kiper said that three others were wounded. Tens of thousands of homes were left without power after Russia attacked the front-line Zaporizhzhia region overnight with drones and missiles. Zaporizhzhia regional head Ivan Fedorov said nearly 60,000 people faced power outages and that two people were wounded in the attacks. He posted photos on Telegram of buildings reduced to rubble.

{"titulo": "Nine people suffer life-threatening injuries in UK after train stabbing attack", "texto": "Nine people suffered life-threatening injuries on Saturday night after a stabbing attack on a train in central England that Prime Minister Keir Starmer described as “deeply concerning.” Two people were arrested after the attack, which British Transport Police (BTP) declared “a major incident,” adding that counterterrorism officers were supporting the investigation. BTP also declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before later rescinding this. Police said 10 people were taken to hospital, nine of whom suffered life-threatening injuries. No fatalities have been reported from the incident. Officers were called at at 7.42 p.m. to a report of the attack on the service from the northern city of Doncaster to London’s King’s Cross. Armed officers were deployed to Huntingdon station, where the train made an unplanned stop and the two people were arrested, police said. More than 12 hours after the incident, police had yet to reveal details about the suspected attackers. Britain’s Defence Minister John Healey told Sky News on Sunday that the incident appeared to be an “isolated attack.” Wren Chambers, who was on the train when the attack happened, told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down. “A minute or so later a man… was running down with a very clear wound, bleeding quite badly on his arm. And I thought it was like some sort of Halloween prank at first. But then he’s shouting that someone’s got a knife, he was stabbed,” she said. After seeing more people running down the train, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get far down the train as they can.” Another witness who was traveling on the train said he saw an “extremely bloodied” victim. The man, who gave his name as Gavin, told Sky News he believed he saw a suspect tasered before he was arrested. He said police shouted “Get down, get down” as they got closer to him. “He then was waving a knife, quite a large knife, and then they detained him,” the eyewitness said. “I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he said. Another male passenger, Olly Foster, told the Daily Mail he’d been listening to an audiobook when the attack happened. “A young girl was distraught as the attacker tried to stab her, but a hero of an older man got in the way taking a gash on his forehead and I think another on his neck,” he said. Video shared on social media of the immediate aftermath of the incident showed a bloodied person rushing out of Huntingdon station and dozens of police and emergency vehicles with flashing blue lights gathered outside. In one video armed officers were seen sprinting down a platform at the station toward the front end of a stationary train. British Transport Police Chief Superintendent Chris Casey called it “a shocking incident” and said his thoughts were with those injured and their families. “We’re conducting urgent enquiries to establish what has happened, and it could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything further,” he said. “At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident.” Emergency first responders said they had mobilized a large-scale response to the stabbing attack, including sending several air ambulances. In a statement on X, the East of England Ambulance Service said it had sent “numerous ambulances, tactical commanders, our Hazardous Area Response Team, and critical care teams,” from several regional jurisdictions. Starmer said on social media: “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” he said on X. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.” Mahmood said she is receiving regular updates on the investigation and urged people to avoid “speculation at this early stage” as to what was behind the stabbings. The rail company that operates trains on the East Coast Main Line, London North Eastern Railway (LNER), said that it was “experiencing major disruption across the LNER route.” The East Coast Main Line is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland. “Our advice is ‘Do Not Travel’. Please defer your travel where you can,” LNER said. It remains unclear at this stage what crimes the attackers will be charged with. Homicide rates in the UK are low compared to other Western nations. Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics. In comparison knife crime has risen overall since 2011, although a 1% decrease was recorded over the past year.

Three victims — two men and a woman — had already been recovered dead on Saturday, while the bodies of two other missing people, a man and his 17-year-old daughter, were found on Sunday morning. “They had been dragged to the lower part of the gully where the avalanche occurred,” said Alpine rescue spokesman Federico Catania. “Rescue teams are now returning to the valley, also considering the worsening weather conditions at high altitude.” The mountaineers, all Germans, were hit by the avalanche at about 4 p.m. on Saturday while climbing near the Cima Vertana, in the Ortles mountains, at an altitude of more than 3,500 meters (11,500 feet). It is unknown why the climbers were still on their way up at this relatively late hour, rescuers said. According to initial information, the climbers were in three groups and were traveling independently of each other. Two men survived the accident and were taken by helicopter to a hospital in the near city of Bolzano. South Tyrol is a popular region for mountaineering among tourists from Germany. The region’s highest peak is Ortles, which rises to 3,905 meters. Avalanche accidents are a persistent issue in the Italian Alps, with the country registering one of the higher 10-year average annual death tolls among major ski nations. Victims are frequently ski mountaineers or freeriders.

Hegseth said addressing the legacies of the war, remains the foundation and a top priority of the countries' defense relationship. At the end of his talks with Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang, Hegseth handed over a leather box, a belt and a small knife — wartime artifacts once taken by U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War. Such returns have become part of broader reconciliation efforts between the two countries, with similar relics — including letters, identification tags and photographs — handed back to the U.S. in recent years. “Today we will exchange artifacts and information from the war with the goal of helping family members in both countries find peace,” Hegseth said. Hegseth’s visit also marks 30 years of diplomatic ties between the former foes and two years since they upgraded relations to a , Vietnam’s highest diplomatic status. He arrived in Hanoi from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he attended a meeting of counterparts from the . Cooperation on postwar issues remains key to U.S.-Vietnam relations.

The visible recommitment to these projects could help stabilize relations and “create space” for further defense cooperation, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore’s ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute. “War legacy cooperation is the foundation enabling deeper defense ties,” he said. “For Washington, it demonstrates long-term responsibility and goodwill to solve lingering war consequences. For Hanoi, it provides essential political cover for expanding relations with a former adversary.” Giang said the U.S. defense chief’s visit comes at a crucial moment. Vietnam’s Communist Party chief, To Lam, visited North Korea in early October — the first such trip in nearly two decades — while reports suggest Hanoi may pursue the purchase of 40 Russian Su-35 fighter jets. “Vietnam is hedging against doubts about U.S. reliability in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.

Two men have been arrested over the , which left almost a dozen people injured. Police are still working to uncover a motive, but say it doesn’t appear to be an act of terrorism. Here’s what to know: The train was heading for London The train left Doncaster in northern England at 6:25 p.m., bound for London’s King’s Cross station. It was about halfway into its 2-hour journey and had just departed from a stop at Peterborough when police began receiving calls about people being stabbed onboard. Passengers described panicked travelers, some covered in blood, rushing down the aisle of the train to get away from the carriage where the violence was unfolding. Olly Foster said he heard someone yelling, “Run, run, there is a guy stabbing literally everyone,” and at first thought it was a Halloween prank — until he noticed blood on his hand from touching seats in the train carriage. “Everyone was really pushing behind us, really panicking,” Foster told the BBC. He said he saw several people bleeding heavily from wounds. Police responded within minutes The British Transport Police, which handles security on the railways, said it received the first emergency calls at 7:42 p.m. Within minutes, several dozen police officers, including specialist firearms officers, and paramedics were at the train station in Huntingdon, a town about 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of London. Soon after, the train made an unscheduled stop at the station and passengers streamed onto the platform as armed police officers ran toward the train. Two suspects were arrested British Transport Police said that within eight minutes of the first emergency calls, officers from Cambridgeshire Constabulary, the local force, had boarded the train and detained two men. Eyewitnesses said officers used a Taser to subdue one suspect who was holding a large knife. Police said the suspects are both U.K.-born British citizens and described them as a 32-year-old Black man and a 35-year-old of Caribbean descent. They were being questioned at separate police stations Sunday on suspicion of attempted murder. Two victims are in life-threatening condition Police said 10 people were taken to nearby hospitals and an 11th went to a hospital on their own. Initially, nine were classed as having life-threatening injuries. But on Sunday morning police said only two people remained in life-threatening condition. Four of the injured had been discharged. Police seek a motive but say it’s not terror Police Supt. John Loveless said counterterror police were initially called in to support the investigation, but that “at this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident.” He said the investigation is being led by British Transport Police, and “it would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause of this incident.” On Sunday the train remained at Huntingdon station and police wearing forensic suits, with a police dog, were working on the platform. Leaders express sympathy Senior politicians and royalty expressed concern and sympathy for the victims and their friends and families. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood paid tribute “to the exceptional bravery of staff and passengers on the train.” King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla were “appalled and shocked.” “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” the royal couple said in a statement. “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/know-stabbing-attack-aboard-train-113958311.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}

{"titulo": "U.S. carries out lethal strike against alleged drug carriers in Caribbean", "texto": "The U.S. military has carried out another in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Saturday. Hegseth, in a social media post, said a U.S.-designated terrorist organization allegedly operated the vessel but did not name which group was targeted. He said three people were killed in the strike. It's at least the 15th such strike carried out by the U.S. military in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific since early September. The U.S. military has now killed at least 64 people in the strikes. \"This vessel—like EVERY OTHER—was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Hegseth said in a post on social media. Hegseth said no U.S. forces were harmed in the strike. The news comes after the Pentagon announced on Oct. 24 that it would be sending the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, to the waters off Latin America. This move dramatically increased the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's to counter narcotics traffickers. President Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. He has asserted the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The White House has repeatedly rebuffed U.S. lawmakers in their demand that the administration release more information about the legal justification for the strikes, as well as greater details about which cartels have been targeted and the individuals killed. Hegseth, in his Saturday post announcing the latest strike, said \"narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home\" and the Defense Department \"will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda.\" Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Oct. 24 that some of those killed in the U.S. strikes have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law. Senate Democrats renewed their request for more information about the strikes in a letter on Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Hegseth. \"We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,\" the senators wrote. Among those signing the letter were Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Sens. Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz. The letter says that thus far the administration \"has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information\" with some members, \"while excluding others.\" Earlier Friday, the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee released a pair of letters sent to Hegseth, written in late September and early October, requesting the department's legal rationale for the strikes and the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force.

{"titulo": "Reports of Mass Killings After Militia Storms City in Sudan", "texto": "udan’s entered a new round of extreme violence this week after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) captured the key city of El Fasher in Western Darfur following a year and a half of siege. Witnesses and local reports described sexual violence, massacres and executions of civilians by the militia as tens of thousands thousands fled the city. El Fasher was seen as the last holdout in Darfur of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), whom the RSF has been fighting for the past . Both sides have been accused of war crimes. Aid agencies raised concern as more than 60,000 people had fled El Fasher, but only 5,000 had arrived in the nearest city of Tawila, some 30 miles away through the desert. Martha Ama Akyaa Pobee, the Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations for Africa, an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that there was no safe passage for civilians to leave. : “In the past week, the U.N. human rights office has documented widespread and serious human rights violations in and around El Fasher,” she said. “These include credible reports of mass killings in various locations and summary executions during house-to-house searches and as civilians have tried to flee the city.” Here is what we know about the atrocities so far. Last weekend, the city of El Fasher was captured by the RSF militia after months of fighting Sudan’s military, a development that led to a series of reported massacres and mass killings by the group against the local population. El Fasher, the Sudanese military's last stronghold in the region, had been under siege for some 17 months before its fall this week. The city was hosting more than a million civilians who had been displaced by the civil war from other parts of the country. The RSF began to mass outside of El Fasher in November 2023, after having led a campaign of conquest across the Darfur region in the months prior. According to the International Crisis Group, the RSF had carried out a campaign of \"massacres, sexual violence, looting and, some say, subjugation\" against non-Arab communities in the territory they held in West Darfur. On April 10, 2024, the RSF declared war on the Sudanese army and various allied groups in Al Fasher, which caused the inhabitants of the city—numbering in the hundreds of thousands—to be trapped and targeted by shelling and bombardment. El Fasher is surrounded by desert, which is hard to traverse on foot even outside of wartime. Hunger ran rampant as the siege continued. The city's fall marks a “significant shift in the security dynamics” of Sudan, Pobee told the Security Council on Thursday, adding that the implications for the country’s civil war and the wider region are “profound.” “The territorial scope of the conflict is broadening,” she said, cautioning that drone strikes by both RSF and SAF were hitting new targets further afield across Blue Nile, South Kordofan, West Darfur and Khartoum. Read More: “The risk of mass atrocities, ethnically targeted violence and further violations of international humanitarian law, including sexual violence, remains alarmingly high,” Pobee said. Within the first few days of sieging the city, the Sudan Doctors Network said that the RSF killed at least 1,500 people as civilians tried to flee the city, describing the situation as “a true genocide.” On Oct. 30, the group the arrival of more than 15,000 displaced persons who fled the mass killings in El Fasher and arrived in the city of Tawila. Despite a communications blackout in the besieged city, testimony from survivors in Tawila has helped aid groups learn more about the killings. The United Nations Human Rights Office said it had seen that show “dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead, surrounded by RSF fighters.” Witnesses who survived the massacres described scenes of chaos as RSF fighters went house to house in El Fasher, beating and shooting at people, including women and children. “It was like a killing field. Bodies everywhere and people bleeding and no one to help them,” one man, Tajal-Rahman, a man in his late 50s, told the Associated Press by phone after escaping to the city of Tawila. One witness, describing the carnage in the city, Alkheir Ismail, told by video interview that he had survived an attack by fighters riding camels near El Fasher, who rounded up a couple of hundred men outside the city and brought them to a reservoir to kill them. He said that one of his captors recognized him from his school days and let him escape. \"He told them, 'Don't kill him,'\" Ismail told Reuters. \"Even after they killed everyone else – my friends and everyone else.\" One of the worst massacres took place at the Saudi Hospital, which was the last hospital still operating in the city during the siege. Christian Lindmeier, a World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman, told a press briefing in Geneva that gunmen abducted doctors and nurses from the hospital before returning to kill at least 460 people—including staff and patients—in several waves of attacks. Lindmeier said at least six medical staff are still being held by the group. The Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health alleged executions around the Saudi Hospital and a previously unreported potential mass killing at an RSF detention site at the former Children’s Hospital in eastern El-Fasher, utilizing satellite imagery collected on October 27 and October 28 outside both sites. The U.N. also received credible reports of organized sexual violence. “At least 25 women were gang raped when RSF’s forces entered a shelter for displaced people near El Fasher University. Witnesses confirm RSF’s personnel selected women and girls and raped them at gunpoint,” Seif Magango, spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said. Aid agencies have raised fears that thousands of civilians are missing, feared dead, or are trapped in El Fasher, after only a trickle of people arrived in Tawila. The U.N. estimated that some 260,000 people were living in El Fasher in late August, and said that fled the city in the last week, but only 5,000 had arrived in Tawila as of Friday, according to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). “The arrival numbers don’t add up, while accounts of large-scale atrocities are mounting,” said Michel Olivier Lacharité, MSF head of emergencies. “Where are all the missing people who have already survived months of famine and violence in El Fasher?” “Based on what patients tell us, the most likely—albeit frightening—answer is that they are being killed, blocked, and hunted down when trying to flee,” Lacharité said. MSF said most people arriving in Tawila were \"women, children, and elderly people with catastrophic levels of .\" \"Others, including gunshot victims, traveled on foot, hiding by daylight and trekking at night to avoid armed men along main roads,\" the aid agency said. The top U.N. humanitarian official, Tom Fletcher, told the Security Council on Thursday that “women and girls are being raped, people being mutilated and killed with utter impunity” in El Fasher. “Tens of thousands of terrified, starving civilians have fled or are on the move,” Fletcher said. “Those able to flee – the vast majority women, children, and the elderly – face extortion, rape and violence on the perilous journey.” “I urge colleagues to study the latest satellite imagery of El Fasher; blood on the sand,” he told the chamber. A senior RSF commander denied the reports of massacres in an interview with Reuters, calling them \"media exaggeration\" by th Sudanese army \"to cover up for their defeat and loss\" of Al Fasher. The RSF is a Darfur-based Sudanese militia that has been fighting the Sudanese military for three years to control the nation. The RSF was formally created in 2013 by former dictator Omar al-Bashir, drawing heavily from the notorious Janjaweed militias that led the 2003–2005 Darfur campaign in which some 300,000 people were killed. : The RSF was the most powerful paramilitary group to emerge from the Bashir era, and the group eventually grew big enough to challenge the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), which began a civil war in April 2023 that ravaged the country, claiming some 150,000 lives and forcing almost a quarter of its population of 50 million to flee their homes.  The RSF has also in particular been subject to extensive accusations of to terrorize communities. Widespread hunger has escalated since last year, when the officially confirmed famine in the Darfur region in August 2024, as the UN estimates that over half of Sudan’s population, meaning at least 25 million people, are in need of humanitarian assistance. Nearly three million displaced Sudanese have fled to other nations in Africa, including refugee camps in Chad, Ethiopia, and South Sudan. Now, RSF controls all major urban centres in Darfur. U.S. lawmakers have accused the RSF of “genocide” and ethnic cleansing against Sudan’s non-Arab ethnic groups throughout the civil war. Now, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are calling on President Donald Trump to respond strongly to the news of massacres in El Fasher. Some have asked Trump to designate the RSF a terrorist organization. \"The horrors in Darfur’s El-Fasher were no accident — they were the RSF's plan all along,” one Senator Jim Risch wrote on X Tuesday. The Idaho Republican joined Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire in a condemning the violence and asking for Trump to consider the designation. “The RSF has waged terror and committed unspeakable atrocities, genocide among them, against the Sudanese people.” Shaheen and other lawmakers have also criticized the United Arab Emirates, which the Sudanese forces say has propped up the RSF with military support, while the UAE maintains that they have supported a ceasefire, telling “the latest UN Panel of Experts report makes clear that there is no substantiated evidence that the UAE has provided any support to RSF, or has any involvement in the conflict.” Earlier this year, Democratic Sen.

{"titulo": "‘No Christian genocide in Nigeria’ gov’t says after Trump’s threats", "texto": "Nigeria has said it would welcome assistance from the United States in fighting armed groups as long as its territorial integrity is respected after US President Donald Trump in the West African country over what he claimed was persecution of Christians there. In a social media post on Saturday, Trump said he had asked the US Department of Defense to prepare for possible “fast” military action in Nigeria if Africa’s most populous country fails to crack down on the “killing of Christians”. “We are not proud of the security situation that we are passing through, but to go with the narrative” that only Christians are targeted, “no, it is not true. There is no Christian genocide in Nigeria,” Kimiebi Imomotimi Ebienfa, Nigeria’s Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman, told Al Jazeera on Sunday. “We’ve continuously made our point clear that we acknowledge the fact that there are killings that have taken place in Nigeria, but those killings were not restricted to Christians alone,” he added. Responding to allegations that the Nigerian government allowed these killings to take place, Imomotimi Ebienfa said: “The killings are not sanctioned by the Nigerian government. The Nigerian government is seriously against that. The killing of any Nigerian in any part of the country is a loss to the country … The perpetrators of these killings are terrorist groups Boko Haram and other al-Qaeda and [ISIL] SIS-affiliated groups that are perpetuating this crisis.” A spokesperson for Nigeria’s presidency, Daniel Bwala, told the Reuters news agency on Sunday that the country would “ “I am sure by the time these two leaders meet and sit, there would be better outcomes in our joint resolve to fight terrorism,” Bwala added. In his post, Trump said the US would immediately cut off all assistance to the country “if the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians”. Earlier, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu pushed back against claims of religious intolerance and defended his country’s efforts to protect religious freedom. “Since 2023, our administration has maintained an open and active engagement with Christian and Muslim leaders alike and continues to address security challenges which affect citizens across faiths and regions,” Tinubu said in a statement. “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.” Nigeria, a country of more than 200 million people, is divided between the largely Muslim north and mostly Christian south. Armed groups have been engaged in a conflict that has been largely confined to the northeast of the country and has dragged on for more than 15 years. Analysts said that while Christians have been killed, most of the victims have been Muslims. While human rights groups have urged the government to do more to address unrest in the country, which has experienced deadly attacks by Boko Haram and , experts say claims of a “Christian genocide” are false and simplistic. “All the data reveals is that there is no Christian genocide going on in Nigeria,” Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian humanitarian lawyer and analyst on conflict and development, told Al Jazeera. This is “a dangerous far-right narrative that has been simmering for a long time that President Trump is amplifying today”. “It is divisive, and it is only going to further increase instability in Nigeria,” Bukarti added, explaining that armed groups in Nigeria have been targeting both Muslims and Christians. “They bomb markets. They bomb churches. They bomb mosques, and they attack every civilian location they find. They do not discriminate between Muslims and Christians.” Ebenezer Obadare, a senior fellow of Africa studies at the Washington, DC-based Council on Foreign Relations, agreed and said the Trump administration should work with Nigerian authorities to address the “common enemy”. “This is precisely the moment when Nigeria needs assistance, especially military assistance,” Obadare said. “The wrong thing to do is to invade Nigeria and override the authorities or the authority of the Nigerian government. Doing that will be counterproductive.”", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/nigeria-welcomes-us-assistance-fight-134917412.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}
{"titulo": "Obama privately backs radical socialist Zohran Mamdani for New York mayor", "texto": "Barack Obama praised Zohran Mamdani in a private telephone call on Saturday, with just days to go before the New York City . The former US president described Mr Mamdani’s campaign as “impressive to watch” in the call and offered his services as a “sounding board”, according to The New York Times. Mr Obama, still a highly influential voice in the Democratic party, has avoided intervention in municipal contests since he left office and has not endorsed any candidate publicly in the New York race, which will go to the polls on Tuesday. In the phone call, which lasted roughly 30 minutes, Mr Obama expressed his support for Mr Mamdani’s success beyond the election and discussed the challenges of staffing a new administration and how to enact the frontrunner’s policies of affordability in the city. The 34-year-old relative newcomer in politics has seen a in the polls since his shock victory over Andrew Cuomo, the former governor, in the Democratic primary in June, and has long been widely projected to triumph in the race. Mr Cuomo is running against him again as an independent candidate, while Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, is the Republican nominee. But Mr Mamdani has been slow to attract endorsements from major holdouts in his party, who have attempted to sidestep association with his radical, far-Left policies. After distancing himself from Mr Mamdani for several months, , the House minority leader, finally endorsed the Democratic nominee on Oct 24. The division is also symptomatic of the rudderlessness of the Democratic Party, which is suffering from a crisis of identity as it continues to reel from sweeping losses in 2024, which saw it squeezed out of power in the federal government. But the Democrats have been flocking to lend their support to a knife-edge vote in neighbouring New Jersey. Mr Obama made an appearance at a campaign rally there on Saturday evening in support of Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat running for governor against Jack Ciattarelli, a Trump-endorsed candidate. Mr Obama used his speech to attack the Trump administration, saying: “It’s hard to know where to start, because every day this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness… I mean, it’s like every day is Halloween, except it’s all tricks and no treats.” Mr Mamdani’s include increasing taxes on New York City’s wealthiest, raising corporation tax, and promoting affordable housing through freezing stabilised apartment rental rates. He has attracted particular admiration among young voters with a viral social media campaign, including a popular stunt which involved walking the length of Manhattan – around 13 miles – to speak to dozens of New Yorkers on the streets. His supporters have contrasted his grassroots efforts, which included sending a 50,000-strong army of volunteers door to door, with the establishment status of Mr Cuomo, who has attracted financial backing from rich donors. However, he has drawn criticism for , which were mocked by JD Vance, as well as for likening the New York police department to the Israel Defense Forces in 2023. Mr Mamdani, a strident Israel critic, was also criticised for refusing to condemn the phrase “globalise the intifada”, which many view as a call to violence against Jewish people. He would be the first Muslim mayor of a city that’s home to almost 900,000 Muslims and has campaigned at 60 mosques across the city, delivering a viral address about his experience of Islamophobia at the Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx in the final weeks of his campaign. Mr Cuomo, who was forced to resign as governor of New York four years ago after the state attorney general found that he had , has trailed behind Mr Mandani by double-digit margins for the entirety of the election. A raft of billionaire New Yorkers, as well as Donald Trump, have urged that Mr Sliwa to avoid splitting the anti-Mamdani vote with Mr Cuomo. Recent polling suggests that Mr Cuomo had between himself and Mr Mamdani to 10 points a week before the election, but Mr Mamdani is still widely projected to forge his way to victory on Tuesday. Early figures suggest the race could attract the highest mayoral election turnout in decades. But the Democratic nominee warned voters on Thursday morning not to become complacent, saying that “the billionaires who rigged our economy and tried to buy an election don’t give up easy”. Mr Trump has called Mr Mamdani a “ ” and vowed to send troops onto the streets of Manhattan in the event of his victory, while Republicans pledged this week to make the frontrunner “synonymous with the Democratic Party nationwide”. Mr Obama first called Mr Mamdani in late June after his primary victory, as Patrick Gaspard, a Mamdani adviser and former political aide in the Obama administration, said the former head of state had initiated the discussion “unsolicited” and “unprompted”.", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/obama-privately-backs-radical-socialist-140344865.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}
{"titulo": "What we know about Sandringham, Andrew’s new home", "texto": "The rapid fall from grace of the now , culminating in his humiliating exile by to the Sandringham estate, has been no less than stunning. His titles and honors are in the process of being formally stripped – he will henceforth be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – and he’s been served notice to surrender his 75-year lease of , the huge mansion he has lived in for more than two decades. It is not yet known exactly when Andrew will leave Windsor, west of the British capital London, for the monarch’s retreat in rural Norfolk. Here’s what we know about the sprawling estate that Andrew will soon call home. Andrew has agreed to move out of the 30-room royal residence he has shared with his ex-wife within the grounds of Windsor Great Park and into a new home in Sandringham. The estate was beloved by the late Queen Elizabeth II and is now said to be a favorite escape for Andrew’s elder brother King Charles and Queen Camilla. Buckingham Palace is keen for Andrew to move to the country estate, roughly 100 miles north of London, as soon as is practical. But it will not happen immediately, a royal source told CNN on Friday. That’s because giving notice, surrendering the lease and other formalities related to the relocation - which is similar to buying a house - could make it a protracted process. was purchased in 1862 by Queen Victoria for her eldest son and heir Albert, later Edward VII, who had just turned 21. It has been the private home of five generations of British monarchs and is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas each year. Sandringham is perhaps the most famous stately home in Norfolk, on England’s east coast. The massive estate is spread across an estimated 20,000 acres, with 600 acres of royal parkland and some 150 properties. Since its purchase, each monarch has helped develop it over the years. The main house was completed in 1870, with a ballroom added 13 years later. Guest and staff accommodation came in the 1890s. It underwent a major overhaul in 1975 when more than 100 rooms in the service wing were demolished “to remove dry rot, save on heating costs and move the kitchens closer to the Dining Room,” according to the Sandringham website. The house was also the location for Queen Elizabeth II’s first televised Christmas broadcast in 1957. Within the grounds sits St. Mary Magdalene Church which is routinely used as a place of worship by the Windsors when in residence. It has become a tradition to see the family walk to it every Christmas morning, greeting well-wishers along the way. The estate also includes an organic farm, sawmill, residential and commercial properties, local parishes and communities. King George V described Sandringham as “the place I love better than anywhere else in the world” while his son and Queen Elizabeth II’s father George VI once wrote, “I have always been happy here and I love the place.” The property’s gardens were the first part of the estate to be opened to the public in 1908 by Edward VII. Elizabeth II later opened the main house to the public in 1977 to coincide with her silver jubilee year. Her husband Philip took responsibility for the estate’s management when Elizabeth acceeded to the throne in 1952. Conservation was at the heart of his approach to ensure that it was maintained for future generations. No family members live at Sandringham House permanently these days, but King Charles frequently visits the grand property. Within its vast grounds there are several properties where the monarch could house his brother. , previously known as Bachelor’s Cottage, was given to then-Duke and Duchess of York – the future George V and Queen Mary – as a wedding gift in 1893 by Edward VII. In recent years it has been used as accommodation for vacationers as well as estate staff and has also been used as the estate office for Sandringham, according to the Times of London. It was also reportedly considered for Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex before they stepped back as working royals. is another viable option. It was previously the home of the estate’s head gardener. The four-bed, three-bath property is currently being used as a holiday let. “This light and airy red brick Edwardian property accommodates up to eight guests, with each room thoughtfully furnished with a blend of rustic pieces, modern comforts, and botanical prints,” the Sandringham website reads. is another available property on the estate. It too is being offered to travelers looking for the chance to “experience the serene splendour” of Sandringham. The original structure dates back to the 1800s and over the years has served as a hunting lodge and a space for ladies to enjoy afternoon tea. It can sleep six guests in its three bedrooms and features a wraparound balcony with a staircase that leads to a turret which “offers panoramic views across the estate,” according to its listing. is an additional property on the estate, but it would require some work. It was where Diana, the former Princess of Wales was born and spent much of her childhood. In the early 80s it was offered to charity Leonard Cheshire, which transformed it into a hotel for disabled people. There were plans for it to be renovated in 2019 which were put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic. is a farmhouse on the estate that has strong ties to Andrew’s parents. It is also where his father, Prince Philip, based himself after retiring from public duties in 2017 at the age of 95. However, it is not thought to be where Andrew will end up. Another option, though it seems incredibly unlikely, is which was gifted to Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales by the late Queen when they wed in 2013. The couple, along with their three children, do not live there permanently but are still thought to spend time during school breaks at the 10-bedroom Georgian property. Andrew is losing his royal titles and styles, as well as his Windsor home after weeks of snowballing scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Public fury was compounded after the publication of a in October, in which she repeated her claims that she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions as a teenager while being trafficked by Epstein. Andrew has always denied the claims made against him. But it is understood that the King took action after the recent developments sparked renewed outrage and threatened to taint the monarchy’s reputation further. His decision to essentially banish his disgraced brother to Sandringham came after consulting legal and constitutional experts, as well as his wider family and the government. Downing Street said Friday that it backed the King’s actions to remove Andrew’s titles and honors. “Our hearts go out to the family of Virginia Giuffre and all the victims who suffered from Jeffrey Epstein’s despicable crimes in all of this. We should never forget that,” a spokesperson said. Andrew will also lose his last remaining military rank as vice admiral of the Royal Navy at the request of King Charles III, British defense minister John Healey told the BBC on Sunday. Sandringham House and its extensive surrounding estate have been handed down through the generations and is privately owned by the sovereign. In comparison, Andrew’s current home in Windsor is part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state. It is understood that the disgraced royal will move to an undisclosed property, with the relocation privately financed by Charles, who will also make financial provisions for his sibling. His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is also moving from Royal Lodge but she will make her own living arrangements and is not expected to join Andrew at Sandringham. The two Pembroke Welsh corgis, will remain in the care of Andrew’s family, Buckingham Palace confirmed to Britain’s PA Media news agency on Friday. However, the palace did not specify if the dogs would stay with Ferguson, head to Norfolk with Andrew or be passed on to their daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

{"titulo": "The end of federal food aid could hit Black Americans hardest", "texto": "NEW YORK (AP) — In one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the nation, a line stretched along the side of the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen and Pantry. Willy Hilaire is homeless, unemployed and 63. He lives in a New York shelter with his two grandchildren and often goes hungry so that they can eat the food he gets from the , or SNAP. On many days, Hilaire’s only food is a hot meal he gets from Holy Apostles in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. With , he worries there won't be enough for him and the children, forcing more sacrifice. “I always tell them, ‘Grandpa is there for you,'” he said. \"'Whatever I have, I’ll give it to you.’” Two federal that President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown. But officials said it was too late to stop recipients from losing benefits on Saturday and that restoring them could likely take at least one week. Reliance on food aid hits Black people harder One in eight Americans use SNAP but its halt will disproportionately hurt Black Americans like Hilaire. Black people are 13.7% of the population but 25.7% of SNAP recipients. Other racial groups get SNAP at rates lower than their overall share of the population. Historians and advocates say that's an example of what's known as systemic racism. There may be no formally racist policy at play but America’s long history of racism — from slavery to unfair zoning rules — has left Black communities with a series of structural disadvantages, and accumulated over generations. White people are nearly 75% of the population but just 35.4% of SNAP recipients, the latest data show. Meanwhile, Black Americans are just 13.7% of the country but more than a quarter of SNAP recipients, the largest overrepresentation of any ethnic or racial group. Hispanic people are underrepresented in the SNAP statistics. Asian Americans are overrepresented but much less than Black Americans. And Native Americans get SNAP at basically the same rate that their group is in the general population. Asian Americans living in poverty face constraints like lack of English fluency and neighborhood gentrification. In New York City, 253,000 of the 1.5 million Asian residents use SNAP, according to the nonprofit Asian American Federation. Over 91% of them work. But, with limited English proficiency, many are limited in their job opportunities, said CEO Catherine Chen. Families who have lived comfortably in cultural enclaves like Chinatown for one or two generations are getting priced out. Working, on food aid A majority of adult SNAP recipients who can work, do. Some still qualify for SNAP — typically $187 a month — despite holding down one or more jobs, according to nonprofit advocates. They’re often low-wage jobs without benefits like paid sick days. A by the National Urban League last year found that the racial income gap has been virtually unchanged for more than 20 years, with Black Americans making 64% of the income of white people, on average. “There’s so much discrimination in the work force, so much discrimination in America today, that Black people who were enslaved and segregated for 350 years are still fighting for economic parity,” said Marc Morial, president of the civil rights group. “While we have a growing number of African Americans, middle-class Americans, we still have a disproportionate number of poor (Black) Americans.” At the current pace, it would take anywhere from one to three centuries for most Black Americans to achieve parity with their white peers, depending on where they live, according to the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility. Worsening statistics This year the highest level since October 2021. Black homeownership fell to the lowest level in four years, according to an analysis by the real estate brokerage Redfin. The Census Bureau found the median Black household income fell 3.3% last year to $56,020. That’s around $36,000 less than what a white household earns. The looming absence of grocery dollars would almost certainly make it harder for families to afford rent, gas and other expenses. Even if SNAP benefits are restored before November ends, nonprofit leaders say low-income residents could face financial setbacks into next year. Tribal nations navigate a web of bureaucracy for food aid For tribal nations, food and nutrition assistance programs are part of the U.S. government’s trust and treaty responsibilities — the government's legal and moral obligations to fund tribes' health and well-being. The U.S. promised to uphold those rights in exchange for the land and resources it took from Indigenous peoples. However, those rights continue to be chronically underfunded and , according to a report released last week by the Brookings Institution. The study found that in 2024, more than two-thirds of trust and treaty responsibilities were funded through discretionary spending, meaning they are not guaranteed during a shutdown. It also noted that one of the largest sources of mandatory spending owed to tribes comes in the form of SNAP benefits. Another U.S. Department of Agriculture program that , the Food Distribution Program in Indian Reservations, is still operating. But Native Americans already enrolled in SNAP cannot participate in that program. FDPIR President Mary Greene-Trottier said in October that her agency asked USDA Undersecretary Patrick Penn for a waiver, which the agency has granted for November, according to a letter Greene-Trottier received on Friday. She she expects to see a substantial increase in demand for her program once SNAP benefits are shut off. “I’ve heard the pleas from the people in the community and outside the community that are just really concerned with not having enough food to eat and the choices between paying medical bills or utility bills that are increasing,” Greene-Trottier said. “I can’t say this loud enough, but this is the weaponization of food again,” she said, a reference to the U.S. government’s historic policies of withholding or cutting off food supplies to starve out tribal nations during the country’s expansion. Meanwhile, tribal nations across the country — including Spirit Lake Nation, Cherokee Nation, Blackfeet Nation, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Shawnee Tribe — declared states of emergency ahead of the loss of SNAP benefits. Misinformation drives stereotypes about SNAP recipients The disproportionate need for food stamps among non-white households has contributed to misinformation and stereotypes. Starting in the 1960s the term “welfare queen” became popular, playing to assumptions that poor people of color were profiting off government assistance rather than looking for work. But two-thirds of the over 40 million SNAP beneficiaries are people you wouldn't expect to work. Thirty-nine percent are children, 20% are elderly and 10% are children or non-elderly adults with disabilities, according to the Urban Institute. Pastor Cleo Lewis, who usually conducts street ministry in Phoenix, organized a food drive for the first time to cushion the blow as much as possible for the 30 families he counsels at a local shelter “We usually are dealing with areas that are spiritually related,” Lewis said. “Now we’re having to increase our presence, and dealing with issues of substance and material issues that we know are significant, but we relied on other professionals to deal with this.” ___ Tang reported from Phoenix.

It affirmed that none of the international or local institutions, nor any driver working with the aid convoys, has filed any report or complaint about looting by Hamas. “This clearly demonstrates that the scene cited by the US Central Command is fabricated and politically motivated to justify blockade policies and the reduction of humanitarian aid,” it said, blaming the US for failing to document the ongoing Israeli attacks following the ceasefire agreement that killed 254 Palestinians and wounded 595. CENTCOM said that the MQ-9 aerial drone was flying overhead to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. “Over the past week, international partners have delivered more than 600 trucks of commercial goods and aid into Gaza daily. This incident undermines these efforts,” it said in the statement. Hamas said the average number of aid trucks entering Gaza daily does not exceed 135, while the rest are commercial trucks bearing goods that Gaza’s population cannot afford “despite our repeated calls to increase the number of humanitarian aid trucks and reduce commercial shipments”. “The US adoption of the Israeli narrative only deepens Washington’s immoral bias and places it squarely as a partner in the blockade and the suffering of the Palestinian people,” it said. The ceasefire took effect on October 10 under US President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan. Phase one of the deal includes the release of the captives in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The plan also envisages the rebuilding of Gaza and the establishment of a new governing mechanism without Hamas. Since October 2023, Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 68,500 people and wounded over 170,600 across Gaza.", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/hamas-rejects-us-accusation-looted-150235135.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}
{"titulo": "Humanitarian disaster worsens across Sudan after RSF takes over el-Fasher", "texto": "Millions of people across war-ravaged Sudan, particularly its western parts, remain in dire need of humanitarian aid as key generals show no intention of ending the civil war amid ongoing violence and killings in North Darfur’s el-Fasher. International aid agencies called on Sunday on the Sudanese armed forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to facilitate increased entry of aid while a has failed to produce a ceasefire so far. A week after the paramilitary force seized el-Fasher, the state capital of North Darfur, after an 18-month siege and starvation campaign, the situation remains catastrophic. Tens of thousands of civilians are still believed to be trapped in the final major city in the western region of Darfur to fall to the RSF while after fleeing el-Fasher. Only a fraction of those who fled on foot from el-Fasher have made it to Tawila, a town roughly 50km (30 miles) away. Speaking to Al Jazeera from Tawila, an official with a France-based aid agency said only a few hundred more people have turned up in the town over the past few days. “Those are very small numbers considering the number of people who were stuck in el-Fasher. We keep hearing feedback that people are stuck on the roads and in different villages that are unfortunately still inaccessible due to security reasons,” said Caroline Bouvard, Sudan country director for Solidarites International. Bouvard said there is a “complete blackout” in terms of information coming out of el-Fasher after the RSF takeover and aid agencies are getting their information from surrounding areas where up to 15,000 people are believed to be stuck. “There’s a strong request for advocacy with the different parties to ensure that humanitarian aid can reach these people or that at least we can send in trucks to bring them back to Tawila.” Many of the numerous RSF checkpoints and patrols to reach Tawila have reported seeing mass executions, torture, beatings and sexual violence. Some were abducted by armed men and forced to pay a ransom on pain of death. Many more have been forcibly displaced to the al-Dabbah refugee camp in Sudan’s Northern State. Some have been there for weeks. Reporting from the camp, Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan said over the past few days, more displaced people have poured in from el-Fasher, exacerbating the humanitarian situation. People are in need of food, clean water, medication and shelter as many are sleeping out in the open. Thousands more could turn to the camp as well as other surrounding areas over the coming days as people flee the slaughter by RSF fighters. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, as mediators, have all condemned the mass killings and called for increased humanitarian assistance. “The RSF must stop engaging in retribution and ethnic violence; the tragedy in El Geneina must not be repeated,” the US Department of State said in a statement on Saturday in reference to the in West Darfur’s capital. “There isn’t a viable military solution, and external military support only prolongs the conflict. The United States urges both parties to pursue a negotiated path to end the suffering of the Sudanese people,” it said in a post on X. US lawmakers have also called for action from Washington in the aftermath of the el-Fasher takeover by the RSF. Republican Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Friday called for the US to officially designate the RSF as a “foreign terrorist organisation”.", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/humanitarian-disaster-worsens-across-sudan-154049261.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}

{"titulo": "'Rounded up': survivors say Sudan's RSF detains hundreds near El-Fasher", "texto": "A young man from one of the towns outlying the western Sudanese city of El-Fasher, Hussein was one of hundreds of men and boys captured and held by paramilitary forces that have overrun the area. \"We were rounded up and taken,\" he told AFP on Sunday, explaining how he and roughly 200 other young men were detained for days by Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fighters in Garni, 25 kilometres northwest of El-Fasher, after they tried to flee. \"They hit us with sticks and called us 'slaves',\" said Hussein, who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of reprisal. The RSF, at war with Sudan's army since April 2023, seized the strategic city of El-Fasher one week ago, pushing the military out of its last stronghold in the region after an 18-month siege marked by starvation and bombardment. Since the takeover, reports have emerged of executions, sexual violence, looting, attacks on aid workers and abductions in and around El-Fasher, where communications remain largely cut off. Hussein said as well as being beaten and insulted, he and his fellow detainees were given only one meal a day. \"They locked us inside a school building. After four days, they released some of us, but every day they brought in new people,\" he said. Darfur is home to several non-Arab ethnic groups, who form the majority of the population and have long been targeted by Arab militias. The RSF traces its origins to the Janjaweed, a predominantly Arab militia accused of genocide in Darfur two decades ago. Reports since El-Fasher's fall have raised fears of a return to similar atrocities. - 'Alive or dead' - The UN said more than 65,000 people have fled El-Fasher, including around 5,000 to nearby Tawila, but tens of thousands remain trapped. Before the final assault, roughly 260,000 people lived in the city. \"Where are all the missing people who have already survived months of famine and violence in El-Fasher?\" asked Michel Olivier Lacharité, head of emergencies for Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The numbers of new arrivals \"don't add up\", he said, while accounts of large-scale atrocities are mounting. Satellite imagery analysed by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab on Friday showed activity consistent with displaced people in RSF-controlled Garni. The lab identified \"multiple objects that measure approximately 2 metres x 3 metres\" at a separate facility that may have been used as a school. Among those detained was Abbas al-Sadek, a lecturer at El-Fasher University. One of his relatives, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal, said that before his disappearance, the lecturer sent a short video pleading with a colleague to transfer $900 to a bank account. In a video, seen by AFP, Sadek is heard to say: \"This money is worth my life and they gave me a short time -- just 10 minutes.\" The money is believed to have been a ransom payment, the relative said. Sadek was later released and is now on his way to Tawila. Many others remain unaccounted for. Zahra, a mother of five who is sheltering in Tawila and also asked to be identified by her first name, told AFP that RSF fighters took her two sons, aged 16 and 20. \"They finally let the younger one go, but I don't know if Mohammed is alive or dead,\" she said, referring to her oldest son. - 'Everyone is looking for someone' - On the road to Garni, Mohamed, a father of four, described seeing \"dead bodies and wounded people left behind because their families couldn't carry them\". \"The RSF robbed us and stopped the young men travelling with us. We don't know what happened to them.\" Another survivor, Adam, said RSF fighters detained him in Garni, accusing him of being a soldier after seeing the blood of his two sons, aged 17 and 21, on his clothes. \"They killed my sons in front of my eyes,\" he said. Adam was released after hours of interrogation, but he said many others remain in captivity. Witnesses told MSF that detainees were separated by gender, age, and ethnic identity, with many still held for ransom. One described \"horrific scenes\" in which prisoners were crushed under vehicles. In Tawila, MSF coordinator Sylvain Penicaud said many are traumatised and searching for missing relatives. \"Everyone is looking for someone,\" he told AFP. He added that many who fled said they were targeted because of the colour of their skin. \"For me, the most terrifying part,\" he said, \"was hearing how people were hunted while running for their lives; attacked simply for being black.\" Both the RSF and the army have faced war crimes accusations during the conflict. The United States has previously determined that the RSF committed genocide in Darfur. bur-lom-maf/csp", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/rounded-survivors-sudans-rsf-detains-154521945.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}
{"titulo": "Childlike sex dolls sold online by Chinese fast-fashion site", "texto": "Fast-fashion giant has been reported by France’s consumer watchdog to authorities for selling “sex dolls with a childlike appearance”. Measuring about three feet tall, the doll appeared to be designed to look like a little girl clutching a teddy bear with dark braids and a doe-eyed expression. The €190 (£170) product was described on the site as a “sex doll…with erotic body” and “realistic” genitalia. The Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) said on Saturday the online description “makes it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content”, adding that it had “referred the matter to the public prosecutor”. The Chinese e-commerce site, best known for selling , electronics, beauty and homeware goods, has since removed the product from the platform and said they have launched an internal investigation. Alice Vilcot-Dutarte, the spokesman for the DGCCRF, told Le Parisien: “The announcements particularly shocked us. Imagine a child browsing the site, looking for a doll, randomly stumbling upon these products.” The DGCCRF also noted the absence of “screening measures” that would have prevented minors from accessing the content, and pointed out that the retail giant has already been condemned in France. Ms Vilcot-Dutarte said: “These reports concern the Shein website and brand, for which deceptive business practices, false claims, and several other non-compliance issues have already been widely identified and penalized.” Shein told Reuters: “The products in question were immediately removed from the platform as soon as we became aware of these major shortcomings.” The company, which is currently based in Singapore, added that it has a “zero-tolerance policy towards any content or products that violate our internal policies or applicable laws”. This year alone, Shein has been fined up to £170 million for breaching EU laws, including using online cookies without consent, for misleading customers about prices and for not declaring the presence of plastic microfibres in its products. The incident also comes just days before the retailer is due to open its first physical shop at Paris’s BHV Marais department store on Wednesday. The opening has been criticised in the fashion capital of the world. Suppliers in France have accused Shein of destroying the retail landscape and the country is helping to lead a against the business model it represents. The company has faced sustained criticism over allegations of and the destructive environmental impact of its mass production model. According to the French Federation of Women’s Ready-to-Wear, more than 15,000 jobs have been lost and dozens of stores have closed over the last three years due to the online marketplace. The retailer is due to open permanent shops in five Galeries Lafayette stores across France in cities like Dijon, Grenoble, Reims, Limoges and Angers. In the latest budget debates, members of parliament recently adopted an amendment that will remove tax benefits for fast-fashion companies like Shein and Chinese marketplace , to “correct their production and marketing methods”.", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/childlike-sex-dolls-sold-online-154615012.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}

Prosecutors charged a 38-year-old woman and a 37-year-old man in connection with the robbery on Saturday, bringing the total number of suspects charged to four. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccau said the man was charged with theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy, and that his DNA was found inside the basket lift that was used to reach the museum's window. The woman is accused of being an accomplice. Beccau said both have denied their involvement in the robbery of priceless crown jewels in a daylight heist that has and stunned art lovers around the world, and both remain in custody while the investigation continues. Two men, aged 34 and 39, both from north of Paris, were charged earlier this week with theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. Beccau revealed on Sunday that two of the suspects, whom the French media have dubbed the \"commando\" team, have lengthy criminal records for theft. The 39-year-old man had 15 convictions, including two for theft, while the 37-year-old had 11 previous convictions, 10 of them for theft, according to Beccau. \"This is not quite everyday delinquency... but it is a type of delinquency that we do not generally associate with the upper echelons of organised crime,\" Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told franceinfo radio. The 34-year-old, reportedly an Algerian national, was arrested as he was about to board a plane to Algeria at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, prosecutors said. His DNA was matched to traces found on a scooter used in the getaway. Three others arrested in connection with the case have been released. Adrien Sorrentino, the lawyer representing the accused woman, told reporters his client is \"devastated\" to have been accused of the crime. \"She does not understand how she is implicated in any of the elements she is accused of,\" he said. : The woman was in tears as she appeared in the dock on Saturday to confirm her address and hear the charges against her, the French daily newspaper Le Parisien .

Beccuau, the prosecutor, has previously expressed anger over leaks from the investigation to the press, saying they risk imperilling . Investigators say the brazen theft took less than 8 minutes on the morning of October 19, during which the thieves escaped with 8 pieces from France’s Crown Jewels. Two of the four thieves entered the museum via the Seine-facing facade at around 9:30 a.m. local time, shortly after the museum’s opening. Using a cherry picker, they accessed the Apollo Gallery jewel room directly on the first floor, which is less than 300 yards from the famed Mona Lisa. The stolen items include emerald- and sapphire-encrusted diadems, necklaces, and brooches once worn by the wives of Napoleon Bonaparte and other 19th-century royals. One piece—the Empress’s crown, fitted with over 1,000 jewels—was found outside the Museum. Other jewels included a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, dating to the early 19th century. Officials estimate the collection's value at roughly $100 million. Officials revealed that surveillance footage showed the thieves entering \"calmly\" and smashing display cases containing the jewels. France's Culture Minister Rachida Dati said there was \"no violence\" during the heist, which she described as \"very professional.\" The heist has also placed President Emmanuel Macron and Louvre director Laurence des Cars under renewed pressure. referred to the incident as “an attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history,” and vowed to “recover the works” and bring the perpetrators “to justice.” Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin later acknowledged serious failures, saying that the fact a freight lift could be installed on a public street outside the Louvre without being detected “shows that our systems must be reassessed.” He added that the incident “projects a negative image of France” and confirmed that a full security review is underway. at .", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/heres-know-suspects-louvre-heist-180155925.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}

{"titulo": "Two Louvre heist suspects a couple with children: prosecutor", "texto": "Small-time criminals are believed to be behind the spectacular jewel heist at the Louvre, the top Paris prosecutor said Sunday, adding that two of the suspects are a couple with children. Last month, a four-strong gang raided the Louvre, the world's most-visited art museum, in broad daylight, taking just seven minutes to steal jewellery worth an estimated $102 million before fleeing on scooters. The thieves parked a truck with an extendable ladder below the museum's Apollo Gallery housing the French crown jewels, clambered up, broke a window and used angle grinders to cut into glass display booths containing the treasures. Two men suspected of being the pair who broke into the gallery while their two accomplices waited outside have been detained, charged and remanded in custody. Prosecutors said on Saturday that two more suspects -- a man and a woman -- had also been charged and remanded in custody. Authorities have so far not recovered the stolen jewels. On Sunday, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that the suspects, who lived in the French capital's northern suburbs, were believed to be small-time criminals and not members of organised crime groups. Their profiles do not correspond to those \"generally associated with the upper echelons of organised crime\", Beccuau told France Info. At least one other person is still being sought, she added. Beccuau said that the 37-year-old man and 38-year-old woman charged on Saturday were a couple and had children together. They have \"denied any involvement\", Beccuau said, adding that the man refused to make any statement. - 'Local people' - The suspects are \"clearly local people\", she said. \"They all lived more or less in Seine-Saint-Denis,\" the prosecutor said, referring to a region north of Paris. \"Some are connected, particularly the couple,\" she said. Two of the male suspects were convicted in a theft case together in 2015, she added. The 37-year-old man has been charged with organised theft and criminal conspiracy, while his partner has been charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy. The woman was in tears as she appeared at a Paris court on Saturday, saying she feared for her children and for herself. The couple were arrested after their DNA was found in the basket lift used during the robbery. \"Significant\" DNA evidence linking the man to the crime was found in the basket lift, the prosecutor said. Traces of his partner's DNA were also found, but they might have been transferred there through contact with a person or object, she added. \"All this will need to be investigated,\" Beccuau said. The man's criminal record contained 11 previous convictions, most of them for theft, she said. - 'Black market' - The first two men arrested earlier were also known to the police for having committed thefts. Both lived in the northeastern Paris suburb of Aubervilliers. One of the two men from Aubervilliers and the man charged on Saturday \"were involved in the same theft case for which they were convicted in Paris in 2015\", said the prosecutor. Three people arrested along with the couple this week have been released without charge. The thieves dropped a diamond- and emerald-studded crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, as they escaped. But they made off with eight other items of jewellery including an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave his second wife, Empress Marie-Louise.

Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said 25 people are still missing and that the government had intensified the search mission, with the military deploying four aircrafts to help teams access the area that has been completely cut off after roads were washed away during Saturday’s landslide. On Sunday, search teams had to abandon the site after flash floods from a hill in the Chesongoch area in Kenya’s Rift Valley region. Heavy rains continue across Kenya, and floods have been reported in several counties, displacing thousands of people. The government has urged those living in flood or landslide prone areas to move, as the rains are expected to continue across the country. Murkomen said the government would continue airlifting supplies to those affected, including to 15 schools that have been cut off, and that ongoing national examination papers would be airlifted to candidates. He said the government would cover the medical bills of more than 30 injured people and resettle dozens of others whose homes were swept away. “It is very sad that families have lost five to six immediate family members,” the minister told journalists on Sunday. Oscar Okum, regional manager for the Kenya Red Cross, said the Rift Valley area was still susceptible to land slides. “Today, while we were doing search and recovery and rescue, we have had roads that are already opened being populated again by mudslides.

{"titulo": "Fears grow for thousands trapped in Sudan's el-Fasher as few reach safety", "texto": "CAIRO (AP) — Only a few thousand Sudanese have reached the nearest camp for displaced people in the days since Sudan’s paramilitary forces seized el-Fasher city, raising fears over tens of thousands who might still be trapped as survivors described killings and other atrocities, an aid group said Sunday. The Rapid Support Forces took control of the western Darfur region last week, after ousting the rival Sudanese army from the city that was besieged for 18 months. Since then, reports and videos have circulated of RSF atrocities against civilians including beatings, killings and sexual assaults, according to testimonies by civilians and aid workers. The dead included at least according to the World Health Organization. The U.N. migration agency said Sunday it estimates that more than 8,000 people were displaced from el-Fasher on Saturday and Sunday. A total of 70,894 people have been displaced since the RSF took control, it said. However, less than 6,000 have made it to the nearest camp in Tawila, 65 kilometers (40 miles) away, said Shashwat Saraf, Sudan director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which runs the camp. Almost 1,000 people arrived in the last three days, he said. “The numbers are still very few. We are not seeing the hundreds of thousands that we were expecting. If people are still in el-Fasher, it will be very difficult for them to survive,” he told The Associated Press by phone from Tawila. Survivors describe dodging gunmen as they fled el-Fasher The fall of el-Fasher marked a new turning point in and Sudan’s armed forces, which erupted in April 2023. More than 40,000 people have been killed, according to U.N. figures, but aid groups say the true number could be many times higher. The war has also displaced more than 14 million people and unleashed outbreaks of diseases, killing thousands. “We feel that a lot of people are stuck in locations from where it is not safe for them to move, and they need to pay to move and they don’t have money to pay,” Saraf said. Survivors who made the journey on foot have shared harrowing details of having to dodge gunmen shooting at them as they fled. “People arriving in the camp are mostly disoriented and dehydrated with bruises all over. Sometimes they do not even remember their names, they have to be taken to the hospital and have IV fluids,” Saraf said. Saraf also said that around 170 unaccompanied children, some of whom as young as 3 years old, trekked to Tawila without knowing where their family members were. They came along with older children or adults who were not their relatives. Sudan's official accuses UAE of backing a “terrorist organization” In a news conference on Sunday, Sudan’s ambassador in Cairo, Imadeldin Mustafa Adawi, accused the RSF of carrying out war crimes in el-Fasher. Adawi said that his government would not negotiate with the RSF, urging the international community to designate the group as a terrorist organization. “The government of Sudan is calling on the international community to act immediately and effectively rather than just make statements of condemnation,” Adawi said. Adawi renewed his government’s accusations that the United Arab Emirates has been arming the RSF, insisting that the Gulf state should not be involved in any mediation efforts. The UAE has backed the RSF and opposed the Sudanese military, pointing to the army's ties to Islamic forces that Abu Dhabi has long opposed. despite evidence to the contrary. When asked earlier on Sunday about his country’s support for the RSF, senior UAE diplomat Anwar Gargash did not directly answer the question while attending the annual Manama Dialogue security summit in Bahrain. He said that the international community made a “critical mistake” in supporting both the military leader, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and his rival, RSF commander when the army ousted a Western-backed power-sharing government in 2021. “We all made the mistake when the two generals who are fighting the civil war today overthrew the civilian government,” Gargash said. “That was, in my opinion, looking backward was a critical mistake. We should have put our foot down -- all of us collectively.” The UAE supports a three-month humanitarian ceasefire, with the two parties negotiating and a civilian transitional government formed in nine months, he said. There are mounting fears that the RSF may expand its military campaign toward the country’s center once again, buoyed by its seizure of the entire Darfur region. Twelve people were killed, including at least five children, in RSF attacks on two camps sheltering displaced people in the central Kordofan region, the Sudan Doctor Network, a medical group tracking the war, said on Saturday. ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Fay Abuelgasim in Cairo, Egypt contributed to this report.", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fears-grow-thousands-trapped-sudans-164442728.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}

Centcom said in a statement that its new Civil-Military Coordination Centre “observed suspected Hamas operatives looting an aid truck travelling as part of a humanitarian convoy delivering needed assistance from international partners to Gazans in northern Khan Younis”.

However, Gaza experts pointed out that the presence of a pick-up truck of the type commonly used by Hamas pointed to the terror group’s involvement. Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a Gaza native now based in the US, said: “What makes the conclusion of the video 100 per cent is the presence of a pick-up truck full of Hamas operatives, passing by the truck as the knocked-out driver is being thrown in the median divider of the road. “These are the pick-up trucks that Hamas’s ‘police’ and enforcers use to roam around Gaza, execute, murder, kidnap, torture, and disappear people.” The UN has reported a significant decrease in the since the ceasefire came into force last month. Stéphane Dujarric, a UN spokesman, said in a briefing on Friday that 5 per cent of collected supplies had been intercepted between Oct 10 and 28, compared to more than 80 per cent between May 19 and Oct 9. Israel currently controls approximately 53 per cent of Gaza, with Hamas in control of most, but not all, of the urban areas to the west of the “yellow” ceasefire line.

Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau noted the apparent “closeness” of the suspects. Two of them were convicted in 2015 in the same theft case and all are based in Paris' northern suburbs. Authorities said the jewelry has not been recovered and the fourth member of is still at large. Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said investigators are also looking for whoever might have ordered the crime. Neither names nor extensive biographical details have been made public, in line with French law that provides that information about investigations is , in part to avoid compromising police work. Here's what to know so far about the suspects: Man aged 34 arrested at Paris airport A 34-year-old Algerian national who has been living in France since 2010 is suspected of being one of the two thieves who entered the Apollo Gallery with disc cutters to cut into the display cases and steal the jewels. He was arrested on Oct. 25, six days after the heist, at Charles de Gaulle airport as he was about to fly to Algeria with no return ticket. The Algerian national lives in a suburb north of Paris named Aubervilliers and is known to police mostly for road traffic offenses and one theft. His DNA matched a scooter used in the getaway. He told investigators he currently has no job but used to work as a garbage collector and delivery man. He faces preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. Another suspect believed to have entered the Apollo Gallery A 39-year-old-man was also arrested on Oct. 25 at his home in Aubervilliers, where he was born. He is believed to be the second man who entered the Apollo Gallery. His DNA was found on one of the glass cases where the jewels were displayed and on items the thieves left behind. He is known to police for several thefts. The 39-year-old is to go on trial later this month for damaging a mirror and the door of the prison cell he was being detained in as part of a separate theft investigation, in which he was later cleared. He told investigators he works as a taxi driver operating illegally. He faces preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. Beccuau said both men gave “minimalist” statements and in the Louvre heist. A 37-year-old man with a record of theft A 37-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday, 10 days after the heist. He is believed to be the third member of the team of four who arrived at the Louvre with a lift truck, simulating renovation work to stop the vehicle at the foot of the museum. The four left on two scooters headed toward eastern Paris. His DNA was found inside the basket lift. The Paris prosecutor said he denied involvement. His criminal record contains 11 previous convictions, 10 of them for theft. He was convicted in 2015 in Paris in the same theft case as the 39-year-old suspect. He faces preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. A 38-year-old woman accused of being an accomplice A 38-year-old woman arrested Wednesday is the longtime partner of the 37-year-old suspect. They have children together. The couple lives in La Courneuve, another northern suburb of Paris close to Aubervilliers. The woman , her lawyer said. A small amount of her DNA was found on the basket lift which could possibly be due to “DNA transfer” according to the Paris prosecutor — that is DNA she may have left on someone or on some item that later transferred on the basket lift.

{"titulo": "Jihadi fighters affiliated with al Qaeda close in on Mali’s capital, as instability grows across Sahel region", "texto": "A well-armed jihadist group affiliated with al Qaeda is closing in on Bamako, the capital of Mali. The country’s military junta and their Russian partners are struggling to counter the jihadis, who now hold sway in many parts of the huge Sahelian country. Fuel is running short in Bamako as militants belonging to a group called Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam al-Muslimin (JNIM) cut roads to the capital, attack military patrols and ambush tanker trucks. As the situation deteriorates, the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany among others have urged their nationals to leave Bamako. On Thursday, the UK warned its citizens to “leave immediately by commercial flight if you judge it safe to do so,” while the cited the “unpredictability of Bamako’s security situation” in encouraging Americans to leave. Video and images from the city in recent days show long lines of motorbikes and other vehicles queuing at gas stations. Some residents have accused the police of sequestering fuel supplies, according to local media. Schools and colleges closed because of the shortages. Over the past two months, JNIM has stepped up attacks on fuel supplies, ambushing tankers on the roads from Ivory Coast and Senegal. In one attack in mid-September, the militants attacked a convoy of more than 100 fuel trucks, setting fire to half of them, according to Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which maps conflicts. The militants have seized large amounts of weaponry from government forces and demonstrated their ability to use drones, says the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), which analyzes terrorist groups. JNIM “has diversified its tactics” terrorism analyst Daniele Garofalo told CNN, stepping up its “economic warfare campaigns with roadblocks, extortion/taxation and fuel blockades.” In a video released last month, JNIM spokesman Abu Hudheifa al-Bambari demanded people cooperate in areas controlled by the group by stopping at its checkpoints and advised them to avoid traveling with military convoys. Government forces have increased patrols and carried out helicopter attacks, claiming to have killed dozens of militants. But the attacks continue, extending fuel shortages to large swathes of central and southern Mali and isolating garrisons of government forces. JNIM has long been active in Mali, a French colony until it gained independence in 1960, and other parts of the Sahel, especially in neighboring Burkina Faso. It was formed in 2017 as a coalition of jihadist factions and immediately declared its allegiance to al Qaeda. It has grown in strength in recent years, bringing instability to much of central and western Mali. This summer it embarked on a campaign of economic warfare in western Mali. It has “attacked factories, industrial facilities, infrastructure projects and artisanal gold mining sites,” according to Garofalo. “JNIM has demonstrated a new level of coordination, conducting operations hundreds of kilometers apart,” he added. Russian mercenaries have deployed to Mali for counterterrorism missions since 2021, first as part of the Wagner Group and now as what Moscow calls the Africa Corps. But they have been unable to stem the militants’ advance and have suffered extensive casualties. Last year, JNIM claimed that a “complex ambush” had wiped out a convoy of Russian contractors and Malian soldiers in the north of the country, killing 50 Russians. The Russian presence appears to have alienated large sections of Mali’s population. A recent Human Rights Watch said the junta and its Russian backers “have committed dozens of summary executions and enforced disappearances of ethnic Fulani men … whom they accuse of collaborating with the JNIM.” Mali and its neighbors – especially Burkina Faso and Niger – have all seen chronic volatility in recent years. JNIM and other militant groups are active in all three countries. In July alone, JNIM claimed 54 attacks in Burkina Faso, 36 in Mali and seven in Niger. Last week, JNIM claimed its first attack in northern Nigeria, which is also wracked by militant violence. Many analysts believe that another coup in Mali, or the collapse of the current regime led by Assimi Goïta, would further destabilize the Sahel, allowing militant groups to expand operations. JNIM has “increasingly integrated into the region’s illicit economies by exploiting fuel and arms smuggling routes in the tri-border area between Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Ghana,” according to the CEP. “It is a conflict amid the fluid borders between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso and there is also a risk of contagion to other states – northwest Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire for example,” said Edmund Fitton-Brown, a former coordinator of the UN Sanctions Monitoring Team and now a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, based in Washington, DC. But Burkina Faso is most at risk, with a fragile military regime that has no writ beyond the capital. “The contagion spreading to Burkina Faso is all but a certainty,” he told CNN. There is no sign of the militants preparing for a frontal attack on Bamako. Their strategy seems to be to strangle the capital and provoke unrest against the military junta. While the Malian army moves slowly and predictably, JNIM militants blend into local communities and get to know their surroundings. “JNIM has become very adept at conveying the discontent and demands of the poorer sections of the population and ethnic minorities,” said Garofalo, who believes its objective seems to be more about presenting itself as a better government. It now has the capacity “to create prolonged crises, disrupt supplies, target secondary centrers and influence public opinion, thereby putting serious pressure on an already politically fragile junta,” Garofalo added. “However, turning this pressure into the fall or replacement of the regime would require seriously escalating operations that have so far been sporadic. JNIM is focusing on systemic weakening and the junta’s loss of local control.” So far it has been succeeding. While JNIM’s ultimate intentions remain unclear, “Mali could become the first country ruled by (al Qaeda) in its four-decade history,” according to the CEP. Fitton-Brown said the junta in Bamako won’t get any support from outside. They “essentially evicted the French and fell out with both the UN and the regional force ECOWAS. The Russians were never going to be an alternative.” “JNIM will eventually insist on a government more to their liking in Bamako, even if they don’t take control themselves and accept something softer than an al Qaeda affiliated regime,” Fitton Brown added.

The train was forced to stop in the small town of Huntingdon, where police and paramedics boarded the train. The two suspects were arrested within eight minutes of the first 911 call, police said. Police described the suspects as a 32-year-old Black man and a 35-year-old man of Caribbean descent, both of whom were natural-born British nationals. They have been detained on suspicion of attempted murder and remain in custody for questioning. In total, paramedics took ten people by ambulance to a local hospital and another later self-presented. Four victims have been discharged but two people remain in life-threatening condition.

A Hamas statement earlier said the remains were found Sunday in a tunnel in southern Gaza. Since the , Palestinian militants had released the remains of 17 hostages, with 11 remaining in Gaza, before Sunday's handover. Militants have released one or two bodies every few days. Israel has urged faster progress, and in certain cases it has said the remains . Hamas has said the work is complicated by widespread devastation. Israel’s military said official identification of these remains would be provided to families first. Emotions around the remains have been high among families, who continue to rally weekly. On Saturday night, Moran Harari, a friend of the late Carmel Gat, urged Israel to have restraint. “This cursed war has taken so many lives of dear people on both sides of the fence. This time, we must not fall into it again,” Harari said during a rally in Jerusalem. Israel in turn has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians for the return of the remains of an Israeli hostage. Health officials in Gaza have struggled to identify bodies without access to DNA kits. Only 75 of the 225 Palestinian bodies returned since the ceasefire began have been identified, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which has posted photos of remains in the hope that families will recognize them. It is unclear if the Palestinians returned were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel that sparked the war, died in Israeli custody as or were recovered from Gaza by troops during the war. The exchange has been the central part of the initial phase of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire. The 20-point plan includes the formation of an international stabilization force of Arab and other partners that would work with Egypt and Jordan on securing Gaza’s borders and ensure the ceasefire is respected. Multiple nations have shown interest in taking part in a peacekeeping force but called for a clear U.N. Security Council mandate before committing troops. Other difficult questions include Hamas’ disarmament and the governance of a postwar Gaza, as well as when and how humanitarian aid will be increased. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier Sunday that “there are still pockets of Hamas” in parts of Gaza controlled by Israeli forces. “There are actually two in Rafah and Khan Younis, and they will be eliminated,” Netanyahu said during a Cabinet meeting. The deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas began with the Hamas-led 2023 attack that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others hostage. has killed more than 68,600 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants.

{"titulo": "Two children among dead in Russian blitz on Ukraine", "texto": "Russia fired a wave of drones and missiles at Ukraine overnight, killing at least six people including two children, and cutting power to tens of thousands, officials said Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks, which also wounded a dozen other people, showed Moscow was aiming to \"inflict harm\" on civilians, and announced that Kyiv had beefed up its air defences in response. Russia has rejected US calls to halt its nearly four-year invasion of Ukraine, instead pushing forward with its ground assault while renewing its campaign of strikes against Ukraine's energy grid. Both countries also claimed to have made gains in the fighting in the key eastern city of Pokrovsk, where Ukraine is under pressure from an intense Russian assault involving thousands of troops. \"Russian forces attacked the Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions. Six people died, including two children,\" the office of Ukraine's prosecutor general said on Telegram. The children were two boys aged 11 and 14, Ukraine's human rights commissioner Dmytro Lubinets said. Russia's attacks cut power to the entire eastern Donetsk region, as well as almost 58,000 households in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, the regions' governors said. Kyiv says the strikes on energy infrastructure are primarily aimed at wearing down the country's civilian population, a charge Russia denies. - Ukraine under pressure - The overnight attacks came a day after Ukraine's top military commander Oleksandr Syrsky announced he had deployed special forces to the eastern city of Pokrovsk, where Kyiv is under pressure from a Russian army thousands strong. Hundreds of Russian soldiers have infiltrated the logistics hub, Kyiv said earlier this week. Others are closing in on its outskirts in a pincer-shaped movement, according to battlefield maps published by the Institute for the Study of War. The city's capture would provide a major propaganda boost for the Kremlin, which has rejected calls for a peace deal on the current front lines. In his evening address Sunday, Zelensky said of the fighting in Pokrovsk, \"where there are results in the destruction of the occupiers\". Earlier Sunday, a Russian army statement had reported the \"destruction\" of Ukrainian troops in Pokrovsk city centre and around the rail station. Russia fired more missiles at Ukraine in overnight attacks during October than in any other month since at least the start of 2023, according to an AFP analysis of data from the Ukrainian air force. Zelensky, who has been pushing his allies for more air defences to hold off Russia's attacks, announced Sunday that Ukraine had strengthened its air-defence network with Germany's support. \"We have strengthened the 'Patriot' component of our Ukrainian air defence,\" Zelensky wrote on social media, referring to the US-made advanced air-defence systems long coveted by Kyiv. Without offering further details, the Ukrainian leader singled out Berlin and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz for thanks. - Russian oil tanker ablaze - Ukraine has responded to Moscow's attacks on its energy grid with retaliatory strikes on Russian oil and gas infrastructure. A Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's Black Sea port of Tuapse early Sunday set an oil tanker ablaze and damaged port infrastructure, regional authorities said. A source in Ukraine's SBU security services said the attack also damaged the Tuapse oil terminal, which belongs to Russian oil major Rosneft. \"Hits by five drones were recorded,\" the source told AFP. Images published on social media purported to show various blazes at the port. AFP was not able to immediately verify the images, and Russian authorities did not immediately comment. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, describing it as a \"special military operation\" to demilitarise the country and prevent the expansion of NATO. Kyiv and its European allies say the war, the largest and deadliest on European soil since World War II, is an unprovoked and illegal land grab that has resulted in a tidal wave of violence and destruction. Tens of thousands of civilians and military personnel have been killed since the invasion began, while millions of Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes. bur-jj/yad", "fonte": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/two-children-among-dead-russian-112723637.html", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "Mundo"}
{"titulo": "British man arrested over mass stabbing attack on a train in England. Here’s what we know", "texto": "Britain was shocked by a on a train Saturday evening that targeted passengers as they traveled through central England on their way to London, in an incident Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described as “deeply concerning.” Nine people were left with life-threatening injuries, one of whom was still fighting for his life in hospital on Sunday evening, after what the British Transport Police (BTP) declared a “major incident.” Though two suspected attackers were initially detained within minutes of police receiving their first emergency call, BTP said on Sunday evening that only one person is now being treated as a suspect. A 32-year-old British man remains in police custody after being arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, the authority said, adding that a 35-year-old British national of Caribbean descent has been released with no further action. Police are working to determine a motive but previously said that there is no evidence to suggest the attack is terror-related. Here’s what we know about the stabbing attack. The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train departed from the northern city of Doncaster at 6.25 p.m. local time on Saturday evening, bound for London. The train had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place. Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm. After seeing more people running past, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get (as) far down the train as they can.” People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train’s toilets, said other witnesses who saw train seats soaked in blood. Police received their first emergency call at approximately 7.42 p.m. local time and immediately deployed armed officers. Within eight minutes of the first call, the two initial suspects were arrested after the train made an unplanned stop at Huntingdon station. Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, British news agency PA Media reported. One eyewitness, who gave his name as Gavin, described seeing one of the men who was initially suspected of being an attacker getting struck down by a police Taser. “Essentially, as they got closer to him, started shouting, like, ‘get down get down’… I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he told Sky News. The train remained at Huntingdon station Sunday morning, with medical equipment and other debris seen strewn on the platform. A total of 11 victims received treatment in hospital. Ten people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, nine of whom were in life-threatening condition, while another person later self-presented that evening. As of Sunday evening, one person remains in hospital in life-threatening condition, BTP said. The man, an LNER staff member who was on the train, had “tried to stop the attacker,” it added. “Detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives,” the statement continued. Little other information has been given at this stage about the victims, including their ages. Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding. Though two people were arrested on Saturday evening on suspicion of attempted murder, police said Sunday evening that one of the men was released from custody after they confirmed that he was not involved. The man still held by authorities is a 32-year-old, Black British national from Peterborough, where he boarded the train shortly before the attack. He is now being treated as the only suspect in the stabbing. “Our investigation is moving at pace and we are confident we are not looking for anyone else in connection to the incident,” BTP’s Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Cundy said in Sunday evening’s statement. “As would be expected, specialist detectives are looking into the background of the suspect we have in custody and the events that led up to the attack,” he added. Earlier Sunday, police said that there is no indication the attack was terror-related. “At this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,” British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless told reporters. “At this stage, it would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause of this incident.” British defense secretary John Healey described the incident as an “isolated attack” in a Sky News interview. BTP had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before rescinding it later. The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations. Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics. In comparison, knife crime has risen overall since 2011. Some 51,527 knife crime offenses were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Of those, 15,689 were recorded in London. British politicians and other key figures expressed their shock at Saturday’s attack and offered their condolences to victims. “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” Starmer wrote on X. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.” In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.” “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” he added. “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.” The East Coast Main Line – on which the train was traveling – is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.

O anúncio ocorreu neste domingo (2) durante sua visita à Aldeia Vista Alegre de Capixauã, em Santarém, no Pará. Lula justificou a iniciativa como um passo necessário, complementando a nomeação de uma ministra e de uma presidente da Funai de origem indígena, além da existência da chefia da saúde indígena. Embora a sede da nova instituição esteja planejada para Brasília, o presidente garantiu que serão estabelecidas extensões em todos os estados. O objetivo é permitir que os estudantes realizem seus cursos próximo de suas residências, evitando o deslocamento até a capital federal.

Em sua fala, Lula sinalizou positivamente para as demandas apresentadas pela aldeia, que incluem questões de saúde, demarcação territorial, habitação (com um programa nos moldes do \"Minha Oca, Minha Vida\"), água e energia. Ele prometeu que o ministro de Minas e Energia visitará o local para tratar da instalação de luz e assegurou aos caciques que \"não tem nada na pauta que vocês me entregaram que a gente não possa fazer\". Marina Silva, por sua vez, ressaltou o pioneirismo do atual governo em nomear a primeira ministra dos Povos Indígenas e a primeira presidente da Funai indígena. Ela defendeu as ações da gestão na demarcação de terras e na redução do desmatamento, destacando a intensidade da queda nas unidades de conservação. Lula expressou orgulho pelas demarcações de terras indígenas e reservas feitas em seus governos, afirmando que nenhum outro gestor demarcou mais. Contudo, ele ponderou que, diante do longo histórico de esquecimento, \"tudo que a gente faz ainda é pouco\". O chefe do Executivo criticou as autoridades em Brasília, dizendo que \"as pessoas não enxergam vocês\" e que, para outros governantes, os indígenas \"não existem\".

O ministro da Defesa, John Healey, disse à Sky News que \"a avaliação inicial é de que foi um episódio isolado, um ataque isolado\". Em comunicado, a Polícia de Transportes Britânica afirmou que \"10 pessoas foram levadas ao hospital, nove delas com ferimentos que se acredita ameaçarem a vida\". \"Este foi declarado um incidente grave, e a Polícia Antiterrorismo está apoiando nossa investigação enquanto trabalhamos para estabelecer todas as circunstâncias e a motivação para este incidente\", acrescentou. A corporação disse que foi acionado o \"plato\", palavra-código nacional usada por polícia e serviços de emergência quando respondem ao que pode ser um \"ataque terrorista em andamento\". Essa declaração foi posteriormente revogada, mas nenhuma motivação para o ataque foi divulgada. \"Estamos conduzindo diligências urgentes para estabelecer o que aconteceu, e pode levar algum tempo até que possamos confirmar mais informações\", disse o chefe-superintendente, Chris Casey. \"Neste estágio inicial, não seria apropriado especular sobre as causas do incidente.\" O ataque ocorreu quando o trem que partiu de Doncaster, no norte da Inglaterra, em direção à estação King's Cross, em Londres, estava aproximadamente na metade da viagem de duas horas. O trem se aproximava de Huntingdon, uma cidade a poucos quilômetros a noroeste de Cambridge. O passageiro Olly Foster disse à BBC que ouviu pessoas gritando \"corram, corram, há um cara literalmente esfaqueando todo mundo\" e inicialmente pensou que pudesse ser uma brincadeira de Halloween. Mas, à medida que os passageiros o empurravam para fugir, percebeu que sua mão estava coberta de sangue de uma cadeira na qual tinha se apoiado. Os serviços de emergência, incluindo polícia armada e helicópteros de resgate, responderam rapidamente quando o trem entrou em Huntingdon. O ataque parece ter sido contido rapidamente após a chegada do trem à estação. Policiais vestidos com macacões forenses, acompanhados de um cão policial, puderam ser vistos na plataforma. A Polícia de Cambridgeshire, força policial local, disse que os agentes foram acionados às 19h39 de sábado para a ocorrência, a cerca de 75 milhas (120 quilômetros) ao norte de Londres. A polícia chegou à estação em poucos minutos. O primeiro-ministro britânico, Keir Starmer, declarou que seus \"pensamentos estão com todos os afetados\" após o \"terrível incidente\". Paul Bristow, prefeito de Cambridgeshire e Peterborough, disse ter ouvido relatos de \"cenas horrendas\" no trem. A London North Eastern Railway (LNER), que opera os serviços da East Coast Mainline no Reino Unido, confirmou que o incidente ocorreu em um de seus trens e afirmou que haverá grande interrupção na rota até segunda-feira.", "fonte": "band", "url": "https://www.band.com.br/noticias/policia-do-reino-unido-detem-dois-suspeitos-por-ataque-em-trem-com-destino-a-londres-202511020948", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "internacional"}
{"titulo": "Ucrânia bombardeia porto russo com drones e danifica embarcações", "texto": "Um ataque com drones ucranianos atingiu na madrugada deste domingo (2) o porto russo de Tuapse, no Mar Negro, danificando ao menos duas embarcações e parte da infraestrutura do terminal de petróleo. O bombardeio faz parte da estratégia de Kiev de enfraquecer o esforço de guerra russo, mirando instalações energéticas consideradas essenciais para Moscou. De acordo com o centro de operações de emergência da região de Krasnodar, \"dois navios civis estrangeiros foram danificados\" após o ataque. As autoridades russas informaram que os incêndios provocados pelas explosões foram controlados e que não houve vítimas entre as tripulações. Imagens não verificadas publicadas em canais russos e ucranianos no Telegram mostram o terminal e um navio-tanque em chamas durante a noite. A agência Reuters afirmou não ter conseguido confirmar a autenticidade dos vídeos. Um oficial do Serviço de Segurança Interna da Ucrânia (SBU) confirmou que as forças ucranianas foram responsáveis pelo ataque. Segundo ele, cinco drones atingiram um navio-tanque, a infraestrutura de carregamento e prédios portuários próximos. O porto abriga o terminal petrolífero de Tuapse, operado pela estatal russa Rosneft, que possui capacidade de processamento de até 240 mil barris de petróleo por dia. A instalação exporta produtos como nafta, óleo combustível e diesel com alto teor de enxofre para países como China, Malásia, Cingapura e Turquia. Ainda não há informações sobre a retomada das operações após o ataque. O Ministério da Defesa russo afirmou neste domingo que suas forças de defesa aérea derrubaram 283 drones ucranianos nas últimas horas. A Ucrânia não comentou oficialmente o ataque a Tuapse. Em resposta, Moscou manteve sua própria ofensiva aérea. Segundo autoridades ucranianas, bombardeios russos na região de Zaporizhzhia deixaram quase 60 mil pessoas sem energia elétrica durante a noite. Duas mortes foram registradas na região de Odessa, no sul do país. Na área de Tuapse, destroços de drones foram encontrados em pelo menos cinco localidades, causando danos a janelas e à estação ferroviária local. O ataque também levou ao fechamento temporário de dezenas de aeroportos no sul e oeste da Rússia, informou a agência reguladora Rosaviatsiya.", "fonte": "band", "url": "https://www.band.com.br/noticias/drones-ucranianos-atingem-porto-russo-de-tuapse-danificando-navios-e-infraestrutura-202511020927", "data_coleta": "02/11/2025", "categoria": "internacional"}

{"titulo": "Físicos descartam hipótese de que o Universo seja uma simulação", "texto": "Físicos podem ter colocado um ponto final em uma das perguntas mais instigantes da ciência: será que ? Uma nova pesquisa, publicada no , liderada pelo físico Mir Faizal, da Universidade da Colúmbia Britânica, indica que a resposta é não. Segundo os cientistas, não existe uma “Teoria de Tudo” capaz de unir perfeitamente a relatividade geral, que explica o espaço e o tempo, com a mecânica quântica, que descreve o mundo das partículas. E como qualquer simulação precisaria seguir regras algorítmicas, a conclusão é que o Universo não pode ser um programa de computador. Um dos grandes problemas da física é entender como o espaço e o tempo, que parecem contínuos, se relacionam com o comportamento das partículas, que é incerto e cheio de possibilidades. Tentativas como a teoria das cordas e a em loop tentaram criar uma ponte entre esses dois mundos, mas todas esbarram em limites matemáticos que não podem ser superados. Os cientistas usaram conceitos de matemáticos famosos como Gödel, Tarski e Chaitin para mostrar que existe um limite para o que qualquer cálculo ou algoritmo consegue descrever. Isso significa que, mesmo que tivéssemos uma física completa, não seria possível reduzir tudo a fórmulas ou . Para lidar com esse limite, os pesquisadores propõem uma camada extra, chamada Meta-Teoria de Tudo, que permite interpretar o que está além da matemática. Ela poderia ajudar a estudar fenômenos complexos, como buracos negros, sem quebrar as leis da física que já conhecemos. A pesquisa mostra que a realidade é mais complexa do que qualquer simulação poderia reproduzir. “Qualquer simulação segue regras de computador, mas a base da realidade não é assim. O universo não pode ser, e nunca poderia ser, uma simulação”, conclui Faizal. Siga a editoria de e fique por dentro de tudo sobre o assunto!

{"titulo": "No segundo dia no Pará, Lula visita aldeia indígena antes da COP30", "texto": "O presidente Luiz Inácio da Silva ( ) visitou neste domingo (2/10) a Aldeia Vista Alegre de Capixauã, na Reserva Extrativista Tapajós-Arapiuns, na Região de Santarém, no Pará. Foi seu 2º dia de agenda na região, onde deve permanecer até a abertura da 30ª Conferência das Nações Unidas sobre Mudanças Climáticas (COP30), marcada para o dia 10 de novembro. Durante a visita, Lula afirmou que a demarcação territorial de terras indígenas não “depende só do presidente da República”. “Isso passa pelo Ministério da Justiça, passa pelos antropólogos, passa pelo não sei de quantas. Depois vai para a FUNAI e depois vem para mim. Mas a hora que chegar a mim veja, eu sei que a gente tem muita coisa para fazer. Mas o que me dá orgulho é que não tem ninguém que já tenha demarcado mais terra indígena do que nós”, declarou. O petista foi recebido na aldeia pela cacique Irenilce Kumaruara, que fez uma demanda de energia para 4.388 famílias, uma população de mais de 13 mil indígenas. O presidente se mostrou surpreso com a falta de energia na comunidade, mas disse que o governo trabalhará na demanda. “Hoje a energia é a coisa mais fácil para a gente fazer, porque a gente pode fazer placa solar, a gente pode preservar o ambiente, pode trazer energia para vocês […] e eu prometo para vocês que vocês vão ter energia aqui na comunidade de vocês”, afirmou o presidente. Ainda segundo Lula, o governo irá anunciar até o dia 17 de novembro, em Brasília, a criação da Universidade dos Povos Indígenas, mas não deu detalhes sobre o projeto. “Vai ter a sede lá em Brasília, já tem até prédio, tanto pode ter o curso principal lá, mas todos os estados vão fazer extensão com a universidade para as meninadas fazer o curso próximo onde more e não precisar ir para Brasília”, explicou. Além da presidente da Funai, estiveram presentes na agenda de Lula as ministras Sônia Guajajara (Povos Indígenas), Marina Silva (Meio Ambiente e Mudança do Clima) e a primeira-dama Janja da Silva. Belém (PA) será a base de trabalho do presidente nos próximos dias, com uma série de compromissos voltados à preparação para a conferência do clima. A única saída prevista do estado é para um evento em Fernando de Noronha, no próximo final de semana. Na segunda-feira (3/11), o presidente deve seguir a programação de visitar comunidades quilombolas, indígenas e extrativistas no Pará. Até o momento, o presidente não tem compromissos oficiais na terça-feira (4/11). A expectativa é que Lula permaneça em Belém, embora a agenda ainda esteja em aberto. Já na quarta-feira (5/11), o presidente deve realizar reuniões bilaterais com chefes de Estado que estarão na capital paraense para a Cúpula dos Líderes, evento que antecede a COP30. Segundo o Planalto, há dezenas de pedidos de encontros com o presidente, mas ainda não há confirmações. Na quinta-feira (6/11) e na sexta-feira (7/11), será realizado o encontro de líderes, que reúne presidentes, primeiros-ministros e demais chefes de governo para impulsionar as discussões do evento. No fim de semana seguinte, nos dias 8 e 9 de novembro, Lula participa do lançamento do projeto Noronha Verde, no Forte Nossa Senhora dos Remédios, em Fernando de Noronha (PE). A ação vai ampliar a geração renovável da ilha por meio de energia solar. Após o compromisso, ele retorna a Belém para acompanhar a abertura oficial da COP30, que será realizada na segunda-feira (10/11). Receba notícias de Brasil no seu WhatsApp e fique por dentro de tudo!

Além da trilha de mariachi, a página inclui uma aba que toca a música “What I’ve Done”, do Linkin Park, em alusão ao fechamento do governo pelos democratas e às consequências da paralisação. O impasse prolongado tem afetado programas essenciais: (programa de assistência alimentar) enfrentam atrasos e aumento da demanda, enquanto outros programas federais estão ficando sem verba. Segundo a mídia internacional, fontes do setor afirmam que a necessidade de ajuda alimentar é maior do que em anos anteriores. A sátira, hospedada na página paródia, inclui textos que caricaturam o líder democrata na Câmara, Hakeem Jeffries, com supostos “posts” sobre o fechamento do governo e piadas sobre grupos progressistas.
